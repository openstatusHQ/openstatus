## Section Writing Tips

### Problem Section

Start with phrases like:
- "You know the feeling..."
- "If you're like most [role]..."
- "Every day, [audience] struggles with..."
- "We've all been there..."

Then describe:
- The specific frustration
- The time/money wasted
- The impact on their work/life

### Benefits Section

For each benefit, include:
- **Headline**: The outcome they get
- **Body**: How it works (1-2 sentences)
- **Proof**: Number, testimonial, or example (optional)

### How It Works Section

Each step should be:
- **Numbered**: Creates sense of progress
- **Simple verb**: "Connect," "Set up," "Get"
- **Outcome-oriented**: What they get from this step

Example:
1. Connect your tools (takes 2 minutes)
2. Set your preferences
3. Get automated reports every Monday

### Testimonial Selection

Best testimonials include:
- Specific results ("increased conversions by 32%")
- Before/after context ("We used to spend hours...")
- Role + company for credibility
- Something quotable and specific

Avoid testimonials that just say:
- "Great product!"
- "Love it!"
- "Easy to use!"
