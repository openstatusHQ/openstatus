## Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) Patterns

These patterns help content appear in featured snippets, AI Overviews, voice search results, and answer boxes.

### Definition Block

Use for "What is [X]?" queries.

```markdown
## What is [Term]?

[Term] is [concise 1-sentence definition]. [Expanded 1-2 sentence explanation with key characteristics]. [Brief context on why it matters or how it's used].
```

**Example:**

```markdown
## What is Answer Engine Optimization?

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of structuring content so AI-powered systems can easily extract and present it as direct answers to user queries. Unlike traditional SEO that focuses on ranking in search results, AEO optimizes for featured snippets, AI Overviews, and voice assistant responses. This approach has become essential as over 60% of Google searches now end without a click.

### Step-by-Step Block

Use for "How to [X]" queries. Optimal for list snippets.

```markdown
## How to [Action/Goal]

[1-sentence overview of the process]

1. **[Step Name]**: [Clear action description in 1-2 sentences]
2. **[Step Name]**: [Clear action description in 1-2 sentences]
3. **[Step Name]**: [Clear action description in 1-2 sentences]
4. **[Step Name]**: [Clear action description in 1-2 sentences]
5. **[Step Name]**: [Clear action description in 1-2 sentences]

## How to Optimize Content for Featured Snippets

Earning featured snippets requires strategic formatting and direct answers to search queries.

1. **Identify snippet opportunities**: Use tools like Semrush or Ahrefs to find keywords where competitors have snippets you could capture.
2. **Match the snippet format**: Analyze whether the current snippet is a paragraph, list, or table, and format your content accordingly.
3. **Answer the question directly**: Provide a clear, concise answer (40-60 words for paragraph snippets) immediately after the question heading.
4. **Add supporting context**: Expand on your answer with examples, data, and expert insights in the following paragraphs.
5. **Use proper heading structure**: Place your target question as an H2 or H3, with the answer immediately following.

Most featured snippets appear within 2-4 weeks of publishing well-optimized content.
```

### Comparison Table Block

Use for "[X] vs [Y]" queries. Optimal for table snippets.

```markdown
## [Option A] vs [Option B]: [Brief Descriptor]

| Feature      | [Option A]          | [Option B]          |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| [Criteria 1] | [Value/Description] | [Value/Description] |
| [Criteria 2] | [Value/Description] | [Value/Description] |
| [Criteria 3] | [Value/Description] | [Value/Description] |
| [Criteria 4] | [Value/Description] | [Value/Description] |
| Best For     | [Use case]          | [Use case]          |

**Bottom line**: [1-2 sentence recommendation based on different needs]
```

### Pros and Cons Block

Use for evaluation queries: "Is [X] worth it?", "Should I [X]?"

```markdown
## Advantages and Disadvantages of [Topic]

[1-sentence overview of the evaluation context]

### Pros

- **[Benefit category]**: [Specific explanation]
- **[Benefit category]**: [Specific explanation]
- **[Benefit category]**: [Specific explanation]

**Tips for FAQ questions:**

- Use natural question phrasing ("How do I..." not "How does one...")
- Include question words: what, how, why, when, where, who, which
- Match "People Also Ask" queries from search results
- Keep answers between 50-100 words

### Listicle Block

Use for "Best [X]", "Top [X]", "[Number] ways to [X]" queries.

```markdown
## [Number] Best [Items] for [Goal/Purpose]

## Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Patterns

These patterns optimize content for citation by AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini.

### Statistic Citation Block

Statistics increase AI citation rates by 15-30%. Always include sources.

```markdown
[Claim statement]. According to [Source/Organization], [specific statistic with number and timeframe]. [Context for why this matters].
```

**Example:**

```markdown
Mobile optimization is no longer optional for SEO success. According to Google's 2024 Core Web Vitals report, 70% of web traffic now comes from mobile devices, and pages failing mobile usability standards see 24% higher bounce rates. This makes mobile-first indexing a critical ranking factor.
```

### Expert Quote Block

Named expert attribution adds credibility and increases citation likelihood.

```markdown
"[Direct quote from expert]," says [Expert Name], [Title/Role] at [Organization]. [1 sentence of context or interpretation].
```

**Example:**

```markdown
"The shift from keyword-driven search to intent-driven discovery represents the most significant change in SEO since mobile-first indexing," says Rand Fishkin, Co-founder of SparkToro. This perspective highlights why content strategies must evolve beyond traditional keyword optimization.
```

### Authoritative Claim Block

Structure claims for easy AI extraction with clear attribution.

```markdown
[Topic] [verb: is/has/requires/involves] [clear, specific claim]. [Source] [confirms/reports/found] that [supporting evidence]. This [explains/means/suggests] [implication or action].
```

**Example:**

```markdown
E-E-A-T is the cornerstone of Google's content quality evaluation. Google's Search Quality Rater Guidelines confirm that trust is the most critical factor, stating that "untrustworthy pages have low E-E-A-T no matter how experienced, expert, or authoritative they may seem." This means content creators must prioritize transparency and accuracy above all other optimization tactics.
```

### Self-Contained Answer Block

Create quotable, standalone statements that AI can extract directly.

```markdown
**[Topic/Question]**: [Complete, self-contained answer that makes sense without additional context. Include specific details, numbers, or examples in 2-3 sentences.]
```

**Example:**

```markdown
**Ideal blog post length for SEO**: The optimal length for SEO blog posts is 1,500-2,500 words for competitive topics. This range allows comprehensive topic coverage while maintaining reader engagement. HubSpot research shows long-form content earns 77% more backlinks than short articles, directly impacting search rankings.
```

### Evidence Sandwich Block

Structure claims with evidence for maximum credibility.

```markdown
[Opening claim statement].

Evidence supporting this includes:

- [Data point 1 with source]
- [Data point 2 with source]
- [Data point 3 with source]

[Concluding statement connecting evidence to actionable insight].
```
