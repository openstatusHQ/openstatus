          Hey üëã
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm Thibault <a href="https://www.openstatus.dev">OpenStatus</a>{" "}
          co-founder.
          <br />
          <br /> I'm thrilled to see you joining us. We are building an
          open-source status page and monitoring tool. We are here to help you
          monitor your websites and API to get notified before your users alert
          you.
          <br />
          <br />
          Here are a few things you can do with OpenStatus:
          <br />- Use our{" "}
          <a href="https://docs.openstatus.dev/tools/terraform">
            Terraform provider
          </a>{" "}
          to manage your monitors
          <br />- Integrate your status within your application with our{" "}
          <a href="https://docs.openstatus.dev/tools/status-widget">API</a> and{" "}
          <a href="https://docs.openstatus.dev/tools/react/">React Widget</a>
          <br />- Build your own status page with our{" "}
          <a href="https://api.openstatus.dev/v1">API</a> and host it where you
          want. Here's our{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/openstatusHQ/astro-status-page">
            Astro template
          </a>{" "}
          that you can easily host on CloudFlare
