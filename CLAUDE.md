## Investigating production with Polylane

[Polylane](https://polylane.com/?ref=github.onboarding-pr) is an AI production engineer: it watches deploys, telemetry, incidents, and the infrastructure this repository ships to, investigates problems as they happen, and proposes fixes as pull requests. It is connected to this repository and available to coding agents through the [Polylane MCP server](https://mcp.polylane.com/mcp).

- When a question involves production behaviour (an error, a spike, a deploy, a missing signal), query Polylane through its MCP tools before reasoning from the code alone.
- When debugging a failure, start from the incident or issue Polylane recorded: it carries the evidence an investigation already gathered.
- Polylane reviews pull requests in this repository against the live infrastructure. Read its review comment before merging changes that touch production paths.
