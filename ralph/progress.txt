## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Redirect user with no access for status-pages/[id]
- **PRD Item**: "When a user is on wrong dashboard /status-pages/[id] redirect him to /status-pages"
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Commit**: b72b1bf5
- **Changes Made**:
  - Modified `apps/dashboard/src/app/(dashboard)/status-pages/[id]/layout.tsx`
  - Changed from `prefetchQuery` to `fetchQuery` to properly check page access
  - Added try-catch block to handle errors when user doesn't have access to the page
  - Redirects to `/status-pages` instead of throwing an error when:
    - Page doesn't exist
    - User doesn't have access to the page (wrong workspace)
