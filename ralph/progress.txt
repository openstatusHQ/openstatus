## 2026-01-15: Table Rename Complete

Completed the "Table Rename" task to rename `monitor_group` table to `page_groups`.

### Changes Made:
1. Updated table name in `packages/db/src/schema/page_groups/page_groups.ts` from `page_group` to `page_groups`
2. Updated `packages/db/src/schema/shared.ts`:
   - Changed import from `selectMonitorGroupSchema` (monitor_groups) to `selectPageGroupSchema` (page_groups)
   - Updated usage in `selectPublicPageSchemaWithRelation`
3. Updated `packages/db/src/schema/monitors/monitor.ts`:
   - Changed relation reference from `monitorGroup` to `pageGroup` (the import was already correct)
4. Updated `packages/api/src/router/page.ts`:
   - Changed import from `monitorGroup` to `pageGroup`
   - Changed import from `selectMonitorGroupSchema` to `selectPageGroupSchema`
   - Updated delete/insert operations to use `pageGroup` instead of `monitorGroup`
   - Updated variable name from `monitorGroups` to `pageGroups` in the transaction

### Notes:
- The folder `packages/db/src/schema/page_groups/` was already created with correct file structure
- The `packages/db/src/schema/index.ts` already exports `page_groups`
- Relation names like `monitorGroup` in queries are kept for backwards compatibility (they reference the Drizzle relation name)
- The old `monitor_groups` folder still exists but is no longer imported by the main schema index

### Next Steps:
- Generate database migration with `pnpm db:generate`
- The migration should include `ALTER TABLE monitor_group RENAME TO page_groups` or equivalent
