Our CLI is now available 🎉

#### OpenStatus CLI ⌨

The OpenStatus CLI gives you the power to manage your monitoring setup directly from the command line. With this new tool, you can:

- List all your monitors: View details on all your configured monitoring checks.
- Triggers check on-demand: Run any of your configured checks immediately, without waiting for a scheduled execution.


####  Get Started 🚀

To start using the CLI, simply install it using brew:

```bash
brew tap openstatus/cli
```

```bash
brew install openstatus
```

Once installed, you can run `openstatus` to see all available commands.

### GitHub Actions Integration Coming Soon 🔜

Our CLI is the first step to have a better CI integration. Stay tuned for updates!
We will release our GitHub Action soon.


We're excited to continue improving the OpenStatus platform to make monitoring your applications and infrastructure even easier. As always, please let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions!
