## About alerting

If you connect notification channels to your OpenStatus account, you can receive alerts when your services are down. We will contact you when an incident is created, ensuring you're the first to know about issues affecting your services.

By default, we don't send any notifications. You need to connect your monitor to a notification channel to receive alerts. This gives you full control over your alerting strategy.

## How alerting works

1. **Monitor detects issue**: Your monitor fails its check (timeout, wrong status code, failed assertion)
2. **Incident created**: OpenStatus creates an incident after confirming the issue
3. **Notifications sent**: All configured channels receive an alert
4. **Recovery notification**: When the service recovers, you're notified again

## Alert management best practices

- **Multiple channels**: Configure backup notification methods
- **Team coverage**: Distribute alerts across team members
- **Escalation**: Use PagerDuty or similar for on-call rotation
- **Noise reduction**: Fine-tune monitoring to avoid false positives

## Notification channels
