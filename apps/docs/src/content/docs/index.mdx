### What is OpenStatus?

[OpenStatus](https://www.openstatus.dev) is an open-source synthetic monitoring tool that helps you monitor the availability and performance of your website, API, servers, or anything that can be monitored from various locations around the world.

We also provide beautiful [status pages](/status-page/overview) to keep your users informed about the status of your services.

#### Monitoring as Code

We provide a [CLI](/cli/getting-started) to manage your monitors as code.
