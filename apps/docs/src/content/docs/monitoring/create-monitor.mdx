## Creating Your First Monitor

A monitor is your automated watchdog for your services. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It periodically checks your endpoints to ensure they are up, performant, and returning the correct data. Think of it as a curl command that runs 24/7.

This guide will walk you through creating and configuring your first HTTP monitor.


## Get Started in 1 Minute

Let's get your first endpoint check up and running.

### 1. Create the Monitor

Navigate to the Monitors page from the sidebar and click the + Create Monitor button.

### 2. Configure the Basics

To get started, you only need two things:
- **Name** : A descriptive name so you can easily identify it (e.g., "API - Production Health Check").
- **URL** : The full URL of the endpoint you want to test (e.g., https://openstat.us).

Once you've set the URL, we'll automatically begin tracking key metrics for every check:
- **Response Time**
- **Status Code**
- **Response Headers**
- **Detailed Timing Metrics** (DNS lookup, TCP connection, TLS handshake, etc.)

### 3. Customizing the HTTP Request

You can customize the HTTP request to simulate real user traffic or test specific scenarios.

#### HTTP Method

Choose the HTTP method for your check. While `GET` is the default, you can also use `POST` or `HEAD` or any other HTTP method.

- `GET`: Retrieve data from an endpoint. The most common choice for health checks.
- `POST`: Send data to an endpoint, for example, to test a form submission or API creation endpoint.
- `HEAD`: Same as `GET`, but without the response body. Useful for quickly checking if a resource exists.

#### Request Body

If you select the `POST` method, you can specify a Body to send with your request. This is perfect for testing API endpoints that require a JSON payload.

#### Custom Headers

You can add any number of custom HTTP headers to your request. This is useful for:

- Sending an `Authorization` token to test a protected endpoint.
- Setting an `Accept` header to request a specific content type (e.g., `application/json`).
- Simulating a request from a specific device or client.

    Heads Up: We've got your User-Agent covered!
    OpenStatus automatically includes the `"User-Agent": "OpenStatus/1.0"` header in every request. This makes it easy to identify and filter out our monitoring traffic from your server logs or analytics.



## Fine-Tuning Your Monitor ‚öôÔ∏è

Once you've set up the basics, you can further refine your monitor's behavior with these advanced options:

<CardGrid>
    <LinkCard
        title="Assertions"
        href="/monitoring/customization/assertions"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Frequency"
        href="/monitoring/customization/frequency"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Locations"
        href="/monitoring/customization/locations"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Timing"
        href="/monitoring/customization/timing"
    />
</CardGrid>



## Important Considerations
### Monitoring Third-Party Endpoints
<Aside>If you're monitoring a URL you don't own (like `google.com` or a partner API), your requests might be blocked by firewalls or rate limiters (e.g., Cloudflare). This is a security measure on their end to prevent scraping or denial-of-service attacks.</Aside>
