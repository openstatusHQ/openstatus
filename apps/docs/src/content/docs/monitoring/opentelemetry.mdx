## How to export your synthetic monitoring data to your observability stack with OpenStatus


OpenStatus supports exporting your synthetic monitoring data to your observability platform using OpenTelemetry.


### How does it work?

When you set up this feature we will export the result of the synthetic checks as metrics.

You can ingest them in your o11y stack.

You can send your metrics to:
- [How to send data to Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/send-data/otlp/send-data-otlp/)
- [How to send data to New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-otlp/)
- Signoz
