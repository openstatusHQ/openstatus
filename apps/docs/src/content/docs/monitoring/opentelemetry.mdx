## How to export your synthetic monitoring data to your observability stack with OpenStatus


OpenStatus supports exporting your synthetic monitoring data to your observability platform using OpenTelemetry.

When you enable this feature, we will export the results of the synthetic checks as metrics.


You can send your metrics to:
