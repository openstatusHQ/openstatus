## What is synthetic monitoring?

With OpenStatus, you can simulate user requests to check the availability and performance of your website, API, or server from different locations around the globe. This proactive approach helps you find issues before your users do.

Synthetic monitoring complements real user monitoring (RUM) by providing:
- **Consistent baseline**: Predictable checks at regular intervals
- **Early warning system**: Detect issues before they affect many users
- **Global perspective**: Monitor from multiple regions simultaneously
- **24/7 coverage**: Continuous monitoring, even when you have no traffic

## How it works

We send a request to your specified endpoint on a regular schedule and record the response. If your website or API is down, timing out, or doesn't return the expected response, we'll alert you right away.

## What is a monitor?

A **monitor** is a job that runs periodically to check the status of a service. This could be a website, an API, or any other service that can be automatically checked. Each monitor you create runs a request to your endpoint and records the results for you to review.

## Creating a Monitor

You can create a new monitor in one of four ways:

- Dashboard: Use our intuitive dashboard to quickly set up and manage your monitors.
- API: Integrate monitor creation into your workflow using our [API](https://api.openstatus.dev/v1#tag/monitor/POST/monitor).
- CLI: Use our command-line interface to create and manage monitors with [YAML configuration files](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/cli-template).
- Terraform: Automate the process with our [Terraform provider](/tools/terraform).

### Monitor types

We support different types of monitors for various use cases:
