## Introduction

Monitoring as code is a practice that allows you to define and manage your monitoring configurations using code. This approach provides several benefits, including:

- **Version control**: You can track changes to your monitoring configurations using version control systems like Git.
- **Reproducibility**: Your monitoring configurations can be easily reproduced across environments.
- **Automation**: You can automate the deployment and management of your monitoring configurations using tools like CI/CD pipelines.


## Getting Started

OpenStatus provides a [CLI](/cli/getting-started) tool that allows you to create, update, and delete monitors as code. To get started, you need to install the CLI tool.

## Examples

### Uptime Monitoring

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://www.openstatus.dev/schema.json
uptime-monitor:
  name: "Uptime Monitor"
  description: "Uptime monitoring example"
  frequency: "10m"
  active: true
  regions:
    - iad
    - ams
    - syd
    - jnb
    - gru
  retry: 3
  kind: http
  request:
    url: https://openstat.us
    method: GET
    headers:
      User-Agent: OpenStatus
  assertions:
    - kind: statusCode
      compare: eq
      target: 200
```

#### Monitoring a MCP Server:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://www.openstatus.dev/schema.json

mcp-server:
  name: "HF MCP Server "
  description: "Hugging Face MCP server monitoring"
  frequency: "1m"
  active: true
  regions: ["iad", "ams", "lax"]
  retry: 3
  kind: http
  request:
    url: https://hf.co/mcp
    method: POST
    body: >
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": "openstatus",
        "method": "ping"
      }
    headers:
      User-Agent: OpenStatus
      Accept: application/json, text/event-stream
      Content-Type: application/json
  assertions:
    - kind: statusCode
      compare: eq
      target: 200
    - kind: textBody
      compare: eq
      target: '{"result":{},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"openstatus"}'
```
