title: How to Add a Status Badge to a GitHub README
description: A step-by-step guide to adding a real-time SVG or PNG status badge to your GitHub repository.
---

## Problem

You want to display the real-time status of your service directly in your GitHub repository's README file. This provides immediate visibility to your users and team members about the health of your application.

## Solution

openstatus provides embeddable status badges that you can add to any Markdown file, including your `README.md`. You can choose between a modern SVG badge or a legacy PNG badge.

## Prerequisites

-   An openstatus account with a configured status page.
-   The "slug" of your status page (the unique name in its URL, e.g., `https://[slug].openstatus.dev`).

## Step-by-step guide

### Step 1: Choose your badge type

We recommend using the modern SVG badge (v2) as it offers more customization options.

-   **SVG Badge (v2)**: More flexible, better styling, and uses a monospaced font.
-   **PNG Badge (Legacy)**: Simpler, but with fewer customization options.

### Step 2: Add the badge to your README

Copy the Markdown snippet for your chosen badge type and paste it into your `README.md` file. **Remember to replace `[slug]` with your status page slug.**

#### Option A: Modern SVG Badge (Recommended)

This is the recommended badge for most use cases.

##### Base URL

```
https://[slug].openstatus.dev/badge/v2
```

##### Markdown Snippet

```
![Status](https://[slug].openstatus.dev/badge/v2)
```

**Example:**

![Status](https://status.openstatus.dev/badge/v2)

##### Customization

You can customize the badge by adding query parameters to the URL.

-   **Theme**: `?theme=dark` (default is `light`)
-   **Size**: `?size=md` (options: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`; default is `sm`)
-   **Variant**: `?variant=outline` (adds a border; default has no border)

**Example with all options:**

```
![Status](https://[slug].openstatus.dev/badge/v2?theme=dark&size=lg&variant=outline)
```

---

#### Option B: Legacy PNG Badge

Use this badge if you prefer the older style.

##### Base URL

```
https://[slug].openstatus.dev/badge
```

##### Markdown Snippet

```markdown
![Status](https://[slug].openstatus.dev/badge)
```

**Example:**

![Status](https://status.openstatus.dev/badge)

##### Customization

-   **Theme**: `?theme=dark` (default is `light`)
-   **Size**: `?size=lg` (options: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`; default is `sm`)

**Example with all options:**

```
![Status](https://[slug].openstatus.dev/badge?theme=dark&size=lg)
```

### Step 3: Commit your changes

Save your `README.md` file and commit it to your repository. The status badge will now be visible to anyone visiting your repository. It will automatically update to reflect the current status of your services.
