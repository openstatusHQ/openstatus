## Problem

You want to validate that your application's critical endpoints are working before deploying to production. Running synthetic tests in your CI/CD pipeline catches issues early and prevents broken deployments.

## Solution

OpenStatus provides a GitHub Action that runs your configured monitors as part of your CI/CD workflow. This guide shows you how to set it up.

## Prerequisites

- An [OpenStatus](https://www.openstatus.dev) account
- A GitHub repository
- At least one monitor configured in OpenStatus
- Admin access to your GitHub repository (for secrets)

## Step-by-step guide

### 1. Create a configuration file

Create a file named `openstatus.config.yaml` in your repository root:

```yaml
tests:
  ids:
    - 1
    - 2
```

**Finding monitor IDs:**
1. Go to your OpenStatus dashboard
2. Click on a monitor
3. The ID is in the URL: `https://www.openstatus.dev/app/[workspace]/monitors/[ID]`

**Tip:** Start with your most critical monitors and expand from there.

### 2. Get your OpenStatus API key

1. Go to your OpenStatus workspace settings
2. Navigate to the API section
3. Create a new API key or copy an existing one
4. Store it securely - you'll need it for the next step

### 3. Add your API key to GitHub Secrets

Secure your API key as a GitHub secret:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `OPENSTATUS_API_KEY`
5. Value: Your OpenStatus API key
6. Click **Add secret**

### 4. Create the GitHub Action workflow

Create `.github/workflows/openstatus.yml`:

```yaml
name: Run OpenStatus Synthetics CI

on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger
  push:
    branches: [ main ]  # Trigger on push to main
  pull_request:        # Run on PRs (optional)

jobs:
  synthetic_ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Run OpenStatus Synthetics CI
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Run OpenStatus Synthetics CI
        uses: openstatushq/openstatus-github-action@v1
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENSTATUS_API_KEY }}
```

### 5. Commit and push

```bash
git add openstatus.config.yaml .github/workflows/openstatus.yml
git commit -m "Add OpenStatus synthetic tests to CI"
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Action will run automatically on the next push to `main`.

## What you've accomplished

Great work! You've successfully:
- ✅ Integrated OpenStatus into your CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Automated synthetic testing on every deployment
- ✅ Added a safety check before production releases
- ✅ Set up continuous validation of critical endpoints

## Customization options

### Run on different branches

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, staging, develop ]
```

### Run on pull requests

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
```

### Run on a schedule

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */4 * * *'  # Every 4 hours
```

### Multiple configuration files

```yaml
- name: Run OpenStatus Synthetics CI
  uses: openstatushq/openstatus-github-action@v1
  with:
    api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENSTATUS_API_KEY }}
    config_file: .openstatus/production.yaml
```

## Best practices

1. **Start small**: Begin with 2-3 critical monitors
2. **Fail fast**: Run synthetic tests early in your pipeline
3. **Monitor the monitors**: Track your synthetic test success rate
4. **Environment-specific**: Use different monitors for staging vs production
5. **Document failures**: Investigate and document any CI failures

## Troubleshooting

**Action fails with authentication error:**
- Verify `OPENSTATUS_API_KEY` secret is set correctly
- Check that your API key hasn't expired

**Monitors not found:**
- Confirm monitor IDs are correct in `openstatus.config.yaml`
- Ensure monitors are active in your OpenStatus dashboard

**Tests timing out:**
- Check that your endpoints are accessible from GitHub's runners
- Consider increasing timeouts in monitor configuration
