In this guide, we will show you how to run a synthetic test in a GitHub Action using OpenStatus.

### Requirements

- An [OpenStatus](https://www.openstatus.dev) Account .
- A GitHub Repository.

### Create a configuration file

First, you need to create a configuration file for your synthetic test.


```yaml
tests:
  ids:
    - 1
    - 2
```
The ids are the ids of the monitors you want to run. You can find the ids in the URL of the monitor page.


### Get your OpenStatus API Key

You can find your API key in the settings page of your OpenStatus account.
Go to the settings page and copy your API key.



### Add your API Key to GitHub Secrets

Go to the settings of your repository and add a new secret with the name `OPENSTATUS_API_KEY` and the value of your OpenStatus API key.


### Create a GitHub Action

Create a new file in your repository under `.github/workflows` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Run OpenStatus Synthetics CI

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  synthetic_ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Run OpenStatus Synthetics CI
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run OpenStatus Synthetics CI
        uses: openstatushq/openstatus-github-action@v1
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENSTATUS_API_KEY }}
```

### Run the GitHub Action

On every push to the main branch, the GitHub Action will run the synthetic tests you have configured in the configuration file.
