In this guide we will show you how to deploy the OpenStatus probe to Cloudflare Containers.

Cloudflare Containers is a platform that allows you to run serverless containers in the Cloudflare network.

The code showcased in this guide is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/private-location-cloudflare-container)

### Requirements
- A Cloudflare Account.
- An [OpenStatus](https://www.openstatus.dev) Account.



### Create a private location on OpenStatus

1. Go to the OpenStatus dashboard.
2. Click on the `Private locations` in the sidebar.
3. Click on the `Create Private Location` button.
4. Give it a human readable name.
5. Save token.
6. Click submit to save the newly created private location.

### Create a Cloudflare Container

1. Create a new cloudflare workers container template using the following command:

```bash
pnpm create cloudflare@latest --template=cloudflare/templates/containers-template
```

2. Fetch openstatus private location image from Docker Hub, we need to specify the platform to linux/amd64 because Cloudflare Containers currently only supports amd64 architecture.:

```bash
docker docker pull --platform linux/amd64 ghcr.io/openstatushq/private-location:latest
```

3. Tag the image, be aware we cannot use the `latest` tag on Cloudflare Containers:

```bash
docker tag ghcr.io/openstatushq/private-location:latest openstatus-private-location:v1
```

4. Push the image to Cloudflare Container Registry:

```bash
pnpm wrangler containers push openstatus-private-location:v1
```
