## Problem: Ensuring Your MCP Server is Always Responsive

Running a Model Context Provider (MCP) server is critical for your AI applications, but traditional HTTP monitoring often falls short. MCP servers communicate using the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol, requiring specific request/response patterns that standard health checks don't cover. How can you confidently ensure your MCP server is healthy and responsive at all times, without custom scripts or complex setups?

## Solution: JSON-RPC Ping Monitoring with openstatus

openstatus offers a robust solution for monitoring your MCP servers. By sending precise JSON-RPC `ping` requests to your endpoint from multiple global locations, openstatus verifies not only network reachability but also the correct functioning of your server's JSON-RPC interface. This guide will walk you through setting up comprehensive monitoring for any MCP server using the openstatus CLI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

-   An [openstatus account](https://www.openstatus.dev/app/login).
-   The [openstatus CLI installed](/tutorial/get-started-with-openstatus-cli). (If you haven't installed it yet, follow this guide first).
-   An MCP server with a publicly accessible endpoint.
-   A basic understanding of the [JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

## Background: Understanding MCP for Monitoring

A Model Context Provider (MCP) is a crucial component that extends AI models with external context, data, or capabilities via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Essentially, it acts as a bridge, allowing AI models to interact with resources like databases, APIs, or file systems that aren't part of their core training.

### The MCP Server and JSON-RPC 2.0

The MCP server is the backend component that hosts these external resources. It processes incoming requests from MCP clients, executes specified actions, and returns information according to the [JSON-RPC 2.0 specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification). JSON-RPC is a lightweight remote procedure call protocol using JSON for data exchange. While transport-independent, MCP servers typically use HTTP/HTTPS, making them readily monitorable by openstatus.

### The Ping Utility: Health Check Standard

For robust monitoring, the official [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#debugging-and-monitoring) recommends implementing a health check using the **ping utility**. This simple request/response mechanism verifies the server's responsiveness and is the foundation for our openstatus monitor.

## Create Your openstatus Monitor: YAML Configuration

openstatus allows you to define and manage your monitors using YAML configuration files, a perfect solution for GitOps workflows. This approach ensures your monitoring setup is version-controlled, auditable, and easily deployable via the openstatus CLI. 

Here's an example of a monitor configuration for a Hugging Face MCP server, which you can adapt for your own MCP endpoint:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://www.openstatus.dev/schema.json

mcp-server:
  name: "HF MCP Server"
  description: "Hugging Face MCP server monitoring"
  frequency: "1m"
  active: true
  regions: ["iad", "ams", "lax"]
  retry: 3
  kind: http
  request:
    url: https://hf.co/mcp
    method: POST
    body: >
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": "openstatus",
        "method": "ping"
      }
    headers:
      User-Agent: openstatus
      Accept: application/json, text/event-stream
      Content-Type: application/json
  assertions:
    - kind: statusCode
      compare: eq
      target: 200
    - kind: textBody
      compare: eq
      target: '{"result":{},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"openstatus"}'
```

### Understanding the Configuration

Let's break down the key fields in this YAML configuration:

-   `name`: A human-readable name for your monitor (e.g., "HF MCP Server").
-   `description`: A brief explanation of what this monitor checks.
-   `frequency`: How often openstatus will run the check. Common values include `30s`, `1m`, `5m`, `10m`, `30m`, `1h`. Setting a sensible frequency balances timely alerts with resource usage.
-   `active`: Set to `true` to enable the monitor, `false` to disable it.
-   `regions`: An array of geographic regions from which openstatus will perform the checks (e.g., `["iad", "ams", "lax"]` for North America, Europe, and West US). Monitoring from multiple regions helps detect localized issues.
-   `retry`: The number of times openstatus will retry a failed check before marking it as genuinely down. This helps prevent false positives due to transient network issues.
-   `kind`: Specifies the type of monitor. For MCP servers using HTTP/HTTPS, this will be `http`.
-   `request`:
    -   `url`: The full URL of your MCP server's JSON-RPC endpoint.
    -   `method`: The HTTP method, which should be `POST` for JSON-RPC requests.
    -   `body`: The JSON-RPC `ping` request payload. The `"method": "ping"` is crucial for triggering the health check on your MCP server.
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": "openstatus",
      "method": "ping"
    }
    ```
    -   `headers`: Standard HTTP headers for JSON-RPC communication.
-   `assertions`: Rules to validate the response from your MCP server. These are critical for determining if the server is healthy.
    -   **Status Code Check**: `statusCode` assertion ensures the HTTP response is `200` (OK).
        ```yaml
            - kind: statusCode
              compare: eq
              target: 200
        ```
    -   **Response Body Check**: `textBody` assertion verifies that the response payload matches the expected JSON-RPC `ping` result. The `target` value must precisely match the successful `ping` response from your MCP server.
        ```yaml
            - kind: textBody
              compare: eq
              target: '{"result":{},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"openstatus"}'
        ```

### Testing Your MCP Server (Optional)

Before deploying your openstatus monitor, it's a good practice to manually test your MCP server's `ping` endpoint using `curl` to ensure it responds as expected. This helps in debugging and confirming the `target` value for your `textBody` assertion.

```bash
curl -X POST \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": "openstatus", "method": "ping"}' \\
  https://hf.co/mcp # Replace with your MCP server URL
```

This command should return a JSON response similar to `{"result":{},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"openstatus"}` if your MCP server is healthy and correctly implements the `ping` utility.

### Using openstatus CLI to Create Your Monitor

Once your `openstatus.yaml` file is ready, create your monitor using the openstatus CLI:

```bash
openstatus create openstatus.yaml
```

This command will upload your monitor configuration to openstatus, and monitoring will begin according to the specified `frequency` and `regions`.
