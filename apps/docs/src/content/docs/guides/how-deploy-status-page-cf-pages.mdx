## Problem

You need a fast, reliable, and automated status page, but you don't want to manage the hosting infrastructure. Manually updating a status page during an incident is inefficient and error-prone.

## Solution

Deploy a custom status page to Cloudflare's global edge network using openstatus as the data source. This guide shows you how to use our Astro-based template to create a status page that automatically reflects your monitoring data.

The code for the template is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/astro-status-page).

  src={statusPage}
  alt="Astro Status Page"
/>

## Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account
- An [openstatus account](https://www.openstatus.dev) with at least one monitor configured.

## Step-by-step guide

### 1. Get your openstatus API key

First, you need an API key to fetch your monitoring data.

1.  Navigate to your openstatus dashboard.
2.  Go to **Settings** → **API Token**.
3.  Click **Create API Key** and copy the key.

### 2. Set up the Astro project

Clone our status page template and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openstatusHQ/astro-status-page.git
cd astro-status-page
npm install
```

### 3. Customize the status page

You need to specify which monitors to display on your page.

1.  Open the `src/pages/index.astro` file.
2.  Find the following line of code:
    ```javascript
    const monitorIds = [1]
    ```
3.  Replace the `1` with the ID of the monitor you want to display. You can find the monitor ID in the URL when you view a monitor in the openstatus dashboard (`/monitors/[ID]`). You can also add multiple IDs: `[1, 2, 5]`.

### 4. Configure your Cloudflare environment variable

Before deploying, you must provide your openstatus API key to Cloudflare.

1.  Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and click on **Workers & Pages**.
2.  Select your site and go to the **Settings** tab.
3.  Navigate to **Environment variables** and add a new variable:
    -   **Variable name**: `API_KEY`
    -   **Value**: Paste your openstatus API key here.

### 5. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

Now you can deploy your status page.

```bash
npm run pages:deploy
```

After the command completes, your status page will be live on Cloudflare Pages. 🎉
