title: Only deploy the openstatus status page (self-hosting) 
description: Complete guide to deploying openstatus status page on your own infrastructure
---


Openstatus is a status page  platform with monitoring capabilities. If you only want to self-host the status page component of openstatus, this guide will walk you through the process.


## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic understanding of Docker and containerization
- Command line experience
- Git installed
- Node.js and pnpm (for database migrations)


### Part 1: Initial Setup and Service Launch

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    Get the latest version of openstatus:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/openstatushq/openstatus
    cd openstatus
    ```

2.  **Configure Your Environment**

    Copy the example environment file. This file will hold all your configuration variables.
    ```bash
    cp .env.docker-lightweight .env.docker
    ```
    Open `.env.docker` in a text editor. At a minimum, you **must** set a value for `AUTH_SECRET` for authentication to work. For a complete setup, review the file for other variables like OAuth providers or email services.


3.  **Build and Start Services**

    Use Docker Compose to build and run all openstatus services in the background.
    ```bash
    export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
    docker compose -f docker-compose.lightweight.yml up -d
    ```

### Part 2: Application Configuration

Now that the services are running, you can access the dashboard and perform the final setup steps.

-   **Dashboard:** `http://localhost:3000`
-   **Status Pages:** `http://localhost:3001`


You can now log in to the dashboard using email authentication. If you want to set up OAuth providers, refer to the environment variable configuration in the `.env.docker` file.


## Next Steps

Create your first status page and start adding static components to monitor your services. For more advanced configurations and monitoring setups, refer to the [full self-hosting guide](./self-hosting-openstatus).
