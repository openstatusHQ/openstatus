## Problem

You want to run openstatus on your own infrastructure instead of using the hosted service. This gives you full control over your data, customization options, and the ability to monitor internal services not accessible from the public internet.

## Solution

openstatus provides a Docker Compose setup that makes self-hosting straightforward. This guide walks you through deploying all necessary services and configuring your self-hosted instance.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic understanding of Docker and containerization
- Command line experience
- Git installed
- Node.js and pnpm (for database migrations)

## Known limitations

Self-hosting openstatus currently has these constraints:

- It only works with private locations. You have to deploy our probes to the cloud provider of your choice.

## Step-by-step guide

### 1. Clone the repository

Get the latest version of openstatus:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus
cd openstatus
```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.docker` and modify the environment variables as needed.

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
```

Review and update the environment variables in `.env.docker` for your setup.

3. Build the containers

Use Docker BuildKit for optimal build performance:

```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
docker compose up -d
```

4. Migrate the database

```bash
cd packages/db
pnpm migrate
```

5. Create Tinybird datasources, pipes and endpoints

```bash
cd packages/tinybird
tb --local deploy 
```

7. Access Tinybird local UI and get your TOKEN

```bash
tb --local open
```

8. Update the `.env.docker` file with your Tinybird TOKEN

9. Connect to your openstatus instance and create a new workspace.

10. Update your newly created workspace with the following limits:

```json
{
  "monitors": 100,
  "periodicity": ["30s", "1m", "5m", "10m", "30m", "1h"],
  "multi-region": true,
  "data-retention": "24 months",
  "status-pages": 20,
  "maintenance": true,
  "status-subscribers": true,
  "custom-domain": true,
  "password-protection": true,
  "white-label": true,
  "notifications": true,
  "sms": true,
  "pagerduty": true,
  "notification-channels": 50,
  "members": "Unlimited",
  "audit-log": true,
  "private-locations": true
}
```

11. Create a new private location in the dashboard.

12. Deploy the private location to your cloud provider of choice with your location api key `OPENSTATUS_KEY`, and  `OPENSTATUS_INGEST_URL` . 

The docker image of the private location is `ghcr.io/openstatushq/private-location:latest`

13. Create monitors and start monitoring your services!

## Service architecture

openstatus consists of multiple services running together:

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| workflows | 3000 | Background jobs and scheduled tasks |
| server | 3001 | API backend (tRPC) |
| dashboard | 3002 | Admin interface for configuration |
| status-page | 3003 | Public status pages |
| private-location | 8081 | Monitoring agent for checks |
| libsql | 8080 | Database (HTTP) |
| libsql | 5001 | Database (gRPC) |
| tinybird-local | 7181 | Analytics and metrics |

## What you've accomplished

Congratulations! You've successfully:
- ✅ Deployed openstatus on your own infrastructure
- ✅ Configured all required services
- ✅ Set up a private location for monitoring
- ✅ Created your first self-hosted monitor

## Troubleshooting

**Containers won't start**: Check Docker logs with `docker compose logs [service-name]`

**Database migrations fail**: Ensure you're in the correct directory and have pnpm installed

**Private location not connecting**: Verify the `OPENSTATUS_KEY` and `OPENSTATUS_INGEST_URL` are correct

**Tinybird issues**: Make sure the Tinybird token is correctly set in `.env.docker`
