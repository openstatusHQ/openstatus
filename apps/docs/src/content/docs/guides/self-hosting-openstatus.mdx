## Problem

You want to run openstatus on your own infrastructure instead of using the hosted service. This gives you full control over your data, customization options, and the ability to monitor internal services not accessible from the public internet.

## Solution

openstatus provides a Docker Compose setup that makes self-hosting straightforward. This guide walks you through deploying all necessary services and configuring your self-hosted instance.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic understanding of Docker and containerization
- Command line experience
- Git installed
- Node.js and pnpm (for database migrations)

## Known limitations

Self-hosting openstatus currently has these constraints:

- It only works with private locations. You have to deploy our probes to the cloud provider of your choice.

## Step-by-step guide

This guide is divided into three parts: launching the services, setting up the database and analytics, and configuring the application through the UI.

### Part 1: Initial Setup and Service Launch

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    Get the latest version of openstatus:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/openstatushq/openstatus
    cd openstatus
    ```

2.  **Configure Your Environment**

    Copy the example environment file. This file will hold all your configuration variables.
    ```bash
    cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
    ```
    Open `.env.docker` in a text editor. At a minimum, you **must** set a value for `AUTH_SECRET` for authentication to work. For a complete setup, review the file for other variables like OAuth providers or email services.

3.  **Build and Start Services**

    Use Docker Compose to build and run all openstatus services in the background.
    ```bash
    export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    You can check the status of the services with `docker compose ps`. It might take a few minutes for all services to be healthy.

### Part 2: Database and Analytics Setup

4.  **Run Database Migrations**

    The database container starts with an empty database. You must run migrations to set up the required schema.
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the root of the openstatus project
    cd packages/db
    pnpm install
    pnpm migrate
    cd ../.. # Return to the project root
    ```

5.  **Deploy Local Tinybird Analytics**

    Tinybird is used for analytics. Deploy the local datasources, pipes, and endpoints.
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the root of the openstatus project
    cd packages/tinybird
    pnpm install
    tb --local deploy
    cd ../.. # Return to the project root
    ```

6.  **Configure Tinybird API Key**

    You need to get your local Tinybird admin token and add it to your environment file.
    ```bash
    cd packages/tinybird
    tb --local open # This opens the Tinybird UI in your browser
    ```
    In the Tinybird UI, find and copy your admin token. Then, add it to your `.env.docker` file in the root of the project:
    ```env
    TINY_BIRD_API_KEY="your-tinybird-admin-token"
    ```
    After adding the token, restart your services for the changes to take effect:
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the root of the openstatus project
    docker compose restart
    ```

### Part 3: Application Configuration

Now that the services are running, you can access the dashboard and perform the final setup steps.

-   **Dashboard:** `http://localhost:3002`
-   **Status Pages:** `http://localhost:3003`

7.  **Create a Workspace and Set Limits**

    -   Navigate to the dashboard at `http://localhost:3002`.
    -   Sign up and create a new workspace.
    -   Because this is a self-hosted instance, you need to manually set the feature limits for your workspace directly in the database.

    The following command updates the limits for the workspace with `id = 1`. If your workspace has a different ID, change the `WHERE id = 1` part of the command.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"statements":["UPDATE workspace SET limits = '\''{\\"monitors\\":100,\\"periodicity\\":[\\"30s\\",\\"1m\\",\\"5m\\",\\"10m\\",\\"30m\\",\\"1h\\"],\\"multi-region\\":true,\\"data-retention\\":\\"24 months\\",\\"status-pages\\":20,\\"maintenance\\":true,\\"status-subscribers\\":true,\\"custom-domain\\":true,\\"password-protection\\":true,\\"white-label\\":true,\\"notifications\\":true,\\"sms\\":true,\\"pagerduty\\":true,\\"notification-channels\\":50,\\"members\\":\\"Unlimited\\",\\"audit-log\\":true,\\"private-locations\\":true}'\'' WHERE id = 1"]}'
    ```
    You can find your workspace ID by inspecting the database with a command like `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"statements":["SELECT id, name FROM workspace"]}'`.

8.  **Deploy a Private Location**

    The self-hosted version relies on private locations to perform checks.
    -   In the dashboard, navigate to **Settings -> Private Locations** and create a new one.
    -   Copy the generated `OPENSTATUS_KEY`.
    -   Deploy the private location probe to your infrastructure using the Docker image `ghcr.io/openstatushq/private-location:latest`.
    -   When deploying, you must provide two environment variables to the container:
        -   `OPENSTATUS_KEY`: The key you just copied.
        -   `OPENSTATUS_INGEST_URL`: The URL of your self-hosted server's API endpoint (e.g., `http://<your-server-ip-or-domain>:3001`).
    -   For a detailed guide on deploying a private location, see **[Deploy Private Locations on Cloudflare Containers](/guides/how-to-deploy-probes-cloudflare-containers)**.

9.  **Create Monitors**

    You're all set! You can now create monitors in the dashboard. They will be checked by the private location you deployed.

## Service architecture

openstatus consists of multiple services running together:

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| workflows | 3000 | Background jobs and scheduled tasks |
| server | 3001 | API backend (tRPC) |
| dashboard | 3002 | Admin interface for configuration |
| status-page | 3003 | Public status pages |
| private-location | 8081 | Monitoring agent for checks |
| libsql | 8080 | Database (HTTP) |
| libsql | 5001 | Database (gRPC) |
| tinybird-local | 7181 | Analytics and metrics |

## What you've accomplished

Congratulations! You've successfully:
- ✅ Deployed openstatus on your own infrastructure
- ✅ Configured all required services
- ✅ Set up a private location for monitoring
- ✅ Created your first self-hosted monitor

## Troubleshooting

**Containers won't start**: Check Docker logs with `docker compose logs [service-name]`

**Database migrations fail**: Ensure you're in the correct directory and have pnpm installed

**Private location not connecting**: Verify the `OPENSTATUS_KEY` and `OPENSTATUS_INGEST_URL` are correct

**Tinybird issues**: Make sure the Tinybird token is correctly set in `.env.docker`
