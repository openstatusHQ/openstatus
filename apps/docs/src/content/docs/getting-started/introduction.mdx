You can use OpenStatus by either signing up for our **cloud version** or by **self-hosting** the application on your own infrastructure.


##  Cloud Version

The easiest way to get started is with our cloud version. You can [sign up for a free account](https://www.openstatus.dev/app/login?ref=docs)
and begin monitoring your services in seconds.


## Self-Hosted Version

For users who want to host OpenStatus on their own infrastructure, all our code is [open source](https://github.com/openstatushq/openstatus)

While we are working on making the self-hosted version easier to deploy, you can start with a community-maintained option like the **Vercel Edge Checker**.

### Vercel Edge Checker

The Vercel Edge Checker is a lightweight version of OpenStatus that you can deploy to Vercel with a single click. It's a great way to get familiar with self-hosting OpenStatus.


<Aside>
We are actively working to simplify self-hosting and have an open [issue](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/issues/322) on GitHub regarding this. Stay tuned!
