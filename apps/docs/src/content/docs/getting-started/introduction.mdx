You can use openstatus by either signing up for our **cloud version** or by **self-hosting** the application on your own infrastructure.


##  Cloud Version

The easiest way to get started is with our cloud version. You can [sign up for a free account](https://www.openstatus.dev/app/login?ref=docs)
and begin monitoring your services in seconds.


## Self-Hosted Version

For users who want to host openstatus on their own infrastructure, all our code is [open source](https://github.com/openstatushq/openstatus).

We offer a few ways to get started with self-hosting:

### With Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started for both development and self-hosting is with Docker.

```sh
# 1. Copy environment file
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker

# 2. Start all services
docker compose up -d

# 3. Access the application
open http://localhost:3002  # Dashboard
open http://localhost:3003  # Status Pages
```

For a complete guide on using Docker, including database setup and configuration, please see our [DOCKER.md](https://github.com/openstatushq/openstatus/blob/main/DOCKER.md) file.

### With Devbox

You can use [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/) to easily manage your development environment.

1.  Install Devbox
    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://get.jetify.com/devbox | bash
    ```
2.  Install project dependencies, build and start services
    ```sh
    devbox services up
    ```
