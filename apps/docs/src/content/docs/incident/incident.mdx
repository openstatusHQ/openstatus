## What is an incident 🧑‍🏫

We automatically create an incident when we detect a problem with your service.
When a monitor fails in more than 50% of the locations, we create an incident.
We do that in order to avoid false positives.

## How to acknowledge an incident

Go to the incident page and click on the acknowledge button.

## How to resolve an incident

Go to the incident page and click on the resolve button.

## Auto resolve an incident

We automatically resolve an incident when the monitor is passing in more than
50% of the locations.


## Incident detail page

On the incident page, you can  see the details of the incident, the monitor that failed, and the duration.
We are also taking a screenshot of the monitor when the incident is created, and when it's resolved.

<Aside>There might be a delay between the incident creation and the screenshot capture. Your endpoint could have already recovered.</Aside>
