You can use the OpenStatus CLI to manage and run your synthetic checks. The CLI is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with OpenStatus from your terminal.

## Installation

You can install the OpenStatus CLI using brew.

```bash
brew tap openstatus/cli
```

<br/>

```bash
brew install openstatus
```

Then you can run the following command to verify the installation.

```bash
openstatus --help
```

You need to get an API token to use the CLI. You can get an API key by signing up on the OpenStatus website.

_Settings &rarr; API Token &rarr; Create API token_

You can set the API token using the following command.

```bash
export OPENSTATUS_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

or you can set the `--access-token` option in the CLI command.

```bash
openstatus [COMMAND] --access-token your-api-token
```
