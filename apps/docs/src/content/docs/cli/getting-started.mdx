You can use the OpenStatus CLI to manage and run your monitors. The CLI is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with OpenStatus from your terminal.

## Installation

You can install the OpenStatus CLI using brew.

#### Windows
```powershell
iwr instl.sh/openstatushq/cli/windows | iex
```

#### macOS
```bash
brew install openstatusHQ/cli/openstatus --cask
```

or


```bash
curl -sSL instl.sh/openstatushq/cli/macos | bash
```



#### Linux
```bash
curl -sSL instl.sh/openstatushq/cli/linux | bash
```



Then you can run the following command to verify the installation.

```bash
openstatus --help
```


##  Usage

You need to get an API token to use the CLI. You can get an API key by signing up on the OpenStatus website.

_Settings &rarr; API Token &rarr; Create API token_

You can set the API token using the following command.

```bash
export OPENSTATUS_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

or you can set the `--access-token` option in the CLI command.

```bash
openstatus [COMMAND] --access-token your-api-token
```
