## What is a monitor? 🧑‍🏫

A monitor is a job that runs periodically and checks the status of a service. It
can be a website, an API, or anything else that can be checked automatically.

We will make a request to your endpoint on a regular schedule and record.

If the check fails, a <a href="/synthetic/features/notification">notification</a> is sent and an <a href="/synthetic/features/incident">incident</a> is created.

<Info>If you are monitoring an endpoint you don't own (e.g google.com), your request might be blocked by the remote server.</Info>


## Configure your monitor 🛠

Your endpoint check requires:

- a **name** to identify your monitor
- the **URL** to checked

We will store the **response time**, the **status code**, the **headers**
returned, and the **timing metrics** of your endpoint.

### HTTP Request 📤

Customize the request sent to your endpoint.

Choose between one of the request **HTTP Method**: `GET` (default), `POST` or
`HEAD`.

Add custom key-value **HTTP Headers** to your request.

> OpenStatus automatically set the `"User-Agent": "OpenStatus/1.0"` header to
> your request. This header is used to identify the request as a ping request
> and can be exluded from your analytics.



If you select the `POST` method, you can add a custom **HTTP Body** to your
request.

### Advanced Configuration ⚙️

You can pause your monitor with the **active** switch button.

#### Frequency ⏱

Define the **frequency** of your checks. You can choose between: `30s`, `1m`,
`5m`, `10m` (default), `30min` or `1h`.

#### Regions 🌍

By default, **all regions** are enabled. You can disable some regions if you
want to. Our regions are:

- `ams` - Amsterdam, Netherlands - 🇳🇱
- `iad` - Ashburn, Virginia, USA - 🇺🇸
- `jnb` - Johannesburg, South Africa - 🇿🇦
- `hkg` - Hong Kong, Honkg Kong - 🇭🇰
- `gru` - Sao Paulo, Brazil - 🇧🇷
- `syd` - Sydney, Australia - 🇦🇺

#### Description 📝

The **description** is optional. If defined, an `Info` tooltip will be added to
your monitor name.

#### Timeout ⏳

You can define a **timeout** for your request. The default value is `30s`.

#### Assertions 🧪

You can add **assertions** to your monitor. An assertion is a condition that
needs to be met for the monitor to be considered successful.

You can add multiple assertions to your monitor.

We currently support the following assertions on the following fields:

- **Status Code**
- **Response Body**


## Public Monitor 🌐

You can make your monitor public by checking **Allow public monitor**.

  <img

    alt="Public monitor setting"
  />



A public monitor is accessible by anyone with the monitor URL.
e.g. https://status.openstatus.dev/monitors/1


  <img
    src="/images/monitor/public-monitor.png"
    alt="Public monitor"
  />

If the monitor is attached to a **status page**, the monitor will be displayed on the status page in the **Monitors** tab.
