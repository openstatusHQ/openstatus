## Overview

An incident in OpenStatus represents a detected problem or service disruption related to a monitored resource. Incidents are automatically generated when a monitor reports a failure condition that meets predefined criteria. They serve as a central point for tracking, managing, and resolving service impairments.

**Key characteristics:**
-   Automatically triggered by monitor failures.
-   Aggregates related failure events for a single monitor.
-   Provides a clear status of service health.

## Incident Triggering

An incident is triggered when a significant percentage of recent monitoring checks for a given monitor report a failed status. This mechanism prevents false positives from transient network issues.

**Trigger Condition:**
-   **Failure Threshold:** An incident is initiated when at least 50% of the checks within a defined window (e.g., the last `N` checks or within a `T` duration) have reported a `failure` or `degraded` status.

## Incident Lifecycle and States

Incidents progress through several states reflecting their current resolution status. These states are managed through status reports (see [Status Report Reference](/reference/status-report)).

**Primary States:**
-   `investigating`: The incident has been detected, and the team is actively looking into the root cause.
-   `identified`: The root cause of the incident has been identified.
-   `monitoring`: A fix has been deployed or a mitigation is in place, and the service is being monitored to confirm resolution.
-   `resolved`: The incident has been fully resolved, and the service is operating normally.

## Properties

While an incident is active, it collects and displays key information related to the service disruption.

-   **Monitor Association:** Each incident is directly linked to the monitor that triggered it, providing immediate context to the affected service.
-   **Start Time:** Timestamp indicating when the incident was first detected and created.
-   **Status Reports:** A chronological log of all updates and state changes applied to the incident.
-   **Impacted Locations:** Details on the geographical regions from which the monitor reported failures.
