## Overview

A subscriber in OpenStatus is an entity (typically a user or an integration) that opts to receive real-time notifications and updates regarding incidents and status changes on a specific status page. Subscribers play a crucial role in maintaining transparent communication during service disruptions.

**Key functions of subscribers:**
-   Receive automated alerts when monitor statuses change or incidents are updated.
-   Stay informed about service health without actively monitoring the status page.
-   Choose preferred notification channels for receiving updates.

## Subscription Process

Users typically subscribe to a status page's updates through a dedicated interface provided on the status page itself. The process involves:

1.  **Inputting Contact Information:** Providing an email address, phone number, or other contact details depending on the available notification channels.
2.  **Opt-in Confirmation:** Confirming their subscription, often through a verification link sent to the provided contact to prevent unwanted subscriptions.
3.  **Channel Selection (Optional):** Selecting which specific notification channels (e.g., email, SMS, Slack webhook) they wish to receive updates through, if multiple options are available.

## Notification Types Received

Subscribers receive notifications for key events affecting the monitored services linked to the status page:

-   **Incident Creation:** When a new incident is detected and published.
-   **Incident Updates:** When status reports are published for an ongoing incident (e.g., status changes from `investigating` to `identified`, `monitoring`, or `resolved`).
-   **Monitor Status Changes:** Direct alerts for individual monitor status changes if configured to do so (less common for public subscribers).

## Subscriber Management

Status page administrators can manage their subscriber lists, including:

-   **Viewing Subscribers:** Accessing a list of all active subscribers for a status page.
-   **Adding/Removing Subscribers:** Manually adding or removing subscribers.
-   **Communication:** Sending ad-hoc notifications to the subscriber list (if supported by the platform).
