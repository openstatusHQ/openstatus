## Overview

Page components are the individual elements displayed on your status page that show the operational status of your services. They provide a flexible way to organize and present both monitored services and static content on your status page.

**Key features:**
- Support for both monitor-linked and static components.
- Organize components into logical groups.
- Custom ordering and arrangement.
- Individual status tracking with incidents, reports, and maintenances.
- Granular control over what appears on your status page.

## Component Types

Page components come in two distinct types, each serving different purposes on your status page.

### Monitor Components

**Type:** `monitor`

Monitor components are linked to an active monitor in your workspace. They automatically inherit the monitor's status and display real-time health information.

**Characteristics:**
- Display live monitor status (up, degraded, down).
- Show active incidents from the linked monitor.
- Include historical uptime data.
- Reflect the monitor's current operational state.
- Automatically update when the monitor changes.

**Use cases:**
- Displaying API endpoint health.
- Showing website availability.
- Tracking critical service dependencies.
- Monitoring infrastructure components.

#### Configuring Monitor Components

When you create a monitor component, you link it to an existing monitor in your workspace. This connection provides several benefits:

**Automatic incident tracking:**
When your monitor detects a failure (connection timeout, HTTP error, assertion failure), an incident is automatically created and displayed on the status page. The component will show an **error** status until the monitor recovers.

**Real-time status updates:**
The component reflects the current operational state of your monitor. If the monitor is actively checking and healthy, your visitors see a **success** status. If checks fail, they immediately see the issue.

**Historical data visualization:**
Monitor components display historical uptime data through status trackers. Depending on your [tracker configuration](/tutorial/how-to-configure-status-page#1-tracker-configuration), you can show:
- **Absolute bar with duration card**: Shows the time spent in each status (success, error, degraded, maintenance).
- **Absolute bar with request card**: Shows the number of successful vs. failed requests.
- **Manual bar**: Shows only the most significant status of each day.

**Uptime calculations:**
Monitor components calculate uptime percentages based on:
- Duration of successful vs. failed checks (for duration-based tracking).
- Number of successful vs. failed requests (for request-based tracking).
- Includes incidents and status reports in the calculation.

**Monitor selection:**
When adding a monitor component, the dashboard shows you available monitors with indicators for:
- **Public/Private status**: Whether the monitor is already public.
- **Active status**: Only active monitors can be linked.
- **Already linked**: Monitors already used on this status page are unavailable.

<Aside type="tip">
You can customize the component name to be different from the monitor name. For example, your monitor might be named "prod-api-health-check" internally, but the component can display as "API Server" for your visitors.
</Aside>

**Status hierarchy:**
1. **Error** - Active incidents from the linked monitor.
2. **Degraded** - Unresolved status reports affecting this component.
3. **Info** - Ongoing scheduled maintenance.
4. **Success** - Healthy and operational.

**What affects monitor components:**
- ✅ Automatic incidents (from monitor failures)
- ✅ Manual status reports
- ✅ Scheduled maintenances

### Static Components

**Type:** `static`

Static components are independent elements not linked to any monitor. They allow you to display services or systems that you manually manage through status reports and maintenance windows only.

**Characteristics:**
- No automatic status updates.
- Status controlled exclusively by manual status reports and scheduled maintenances.
- Useful for third-party services or manual tracking.
- Do not display incidents (no automatic incident creation).
- Provide flexibility for non-monitored services.

**Use cases:**
- Third-party service dependencies (e.g., payment providers like Stripe, email services like SendGrid).
- Manual status tracking for systems without monitors.
- Services monitored through external tools.
- Components that only need maintenance window communication.
- Legacy systems without API endpoints to monitor.

<Aside type="caution">
Static components **only** respond to manual status reports and scheduled maintenances. They never automatically detect issues or create incidents. If you need automatic failure detection, use a monitor component instead.
</Aside>

#### Managing Static Components

Static components give you full manual control over what your visitors see:

**Status reports:**
Create status reports to indicate issues or degraded performance for static components. For example:
- "Stripe payment processing experiencing delays" (degraded status).
- "Email delivery service partially unavailable" (degraded status).

Once you resolve the issue and mark the status report as resolved, the component returns to a success status.

**Maintenance windows:**
Schedule maintenance windows to inform visitors about planned downtime:
- "Scheduled database backup - Sunday 2:00 AM - 4:00 AM" (info status).
- "Third-party CDN maintenance window" (info status).

During the maintenance window, the component shows an info status. After the window ends, it returns to its previous status.

**No automatic monitoring:**
Static components do not perform any health checks or generate incidents. You are responsible for:
- Monitoring the service through other means.
- Creating status reports when issues occur.
- Updating reports when issues are resolved.
- Communicating maintenance windows in advance.

**Status hierarchy:**
1. **Degraded** - Unresolved status reports affecting this component.
2. **Info** - Ongoing scheduled maintenance.
3. **Success** - No active reports or maintenances.

**What affects static components:**
- ✅ Manual status reports
- ✅ Scheduled maintenances
- ❌ Automatic incidents (not supported)

## Component Groups

Component groups allow you to organize related page components into logical sections on your status page. Groups improve readability and help visitors understand your service architecture.

**Benefits:**
- Visual organization of related services.
- Collapsible sections for better page structure.
- Independent ordering within groups.
- Clear service categorization.

**Examples of grouping strategies:**

| Group Name | Components |
|------------|------------|
| **API Services** | Authentication API, Data API, WebSocket API |
| **Infrastructure** | Database, Cache, Message Queue |
| **External Dependencies** | Payment Provider, Email Service, CDN |
| **Regional Services** | US Region, EU Region, APAC Region |

**Group configuration:**
- **Name:** The group heading displayed on your status page.
- **Order:** Position of the group relative to other groups and ungrouped components.
- **Components:** The page components contained within this group.
## Events and Status

Page components can be affected by up to three types of events that influence their displayed status. The type of component determines which events apply:

| Event Type | Monitor Components | Static Components |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Incidents** | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Not supported |
| **Status Reports** | ✅ Manual | ✅ Manual |
| **Maintenances** | ✅ Manual | ✅ Manual |

### Incidents

**Applies to:** Monitor components only

Incidents are automatically generated when a monitor detects a failure. They represent unplanned outages or degraded performance discovered through active monitoring.

**How incidents are created:**
- Monitor check fails (connection timeout, HTTP error, DNS failure).
- Monitor assertion fails (wrong status code, unexpected response body).
- Monitor reaches degraded threshold (response time too slow).

**Status impact:** Components with active incidents show an **error** status. This takes the highest priority in the status hierarchy.

**Resolution:** Incidents are automatically resolved when the monitor recovers and checks succeed again.

<Aside>
Static components **never** generate incidents because they are not linked to monitors. Use status reports for manual issue tracking on static components.
</Aside>

### Status Reports

**Applies to:** Both monitor and static components

Status reports are manually created updates about component health or issues. They provide a way to communicate problems that may not trigger automatic monitoring or to manually report issues with static components.

**Status impact:** Components with unresolved status reports show a **degraded** status (unless overridden by an incident for monitor components).

**Use cases for monitor components:**
- Reporting known issues that don't cause complete outages.
- Communicating performance degradation not captured by monitoring.
- Providing context for intermittent issues.

**Use cases for static components:**
- Reporting third-party service issues (e.g., "Stripe processing delays").
- Communicating external service degradation.
- Announcing partial outages of non-monitored systems.

**Attaching to components:** When creating a status report, you can select which components are affected. Multiple components can be attached to a single report.

### Maintenances

**Applies to:** Both monitor and static components

Maintenances are scheduled maintenance windows that you create in advance. They inform visitors about planned downtime or service interruptions for both monitored and static components.

**Status impact:** Components with ongoing maintenances show an **info** status (unless overridden by incidents or reports).

**Use cases for monitor components:**
- Scheduled system upgrades that will cause downtime.
- Infrastructure changes that affect monitored services.
- Planned deployments requiring service restarts.

**Use cases for static components:**
- Third-party maintenance windows (e.g., "Payment provider scheduled maintenance").
- External service upgrade notifications.
- Planned downtime for non-monitored dependencies.

**Scheduling:** Maintenances have a defined start and end time. The info status automatically appears during the window and disappears when the maintenance ends.

**Attaching to components:** When creating a maintenance, you select which components will be affected. This allows you to communicate maintenance impact across multiple services.

## Managing Components

### Adding Components

You can add components to your status page in two ways:

1. **Individual components:** Add a single component outside of any group.
2. **Components within groups:** Add a component directly into a new or existing group.

When adding a monitor component, you can only select from monitors that:
- Are currently active.
- Have not been deleted.
- Are not already linked to another component on this status page.

### Reordering Components

Components and groups can be reordered using drag-and-drop functionality in the dashboard. The order determines how they appear on your status page from top to bottom.

**Ordering tips:**
- Place your most critical services at the top.
- Group related services together.
- Consider visitor priorities when ordering.

### Editing Components

You can modify the following properties of existing components:
- Component name and description.
- Group assignment (move between groups or make ungrouped).
- Display order.

**Note:** You cannot change a component's type (monitor to static or vice versa) after creation. To change types, delete the component and create a new one.

### Deleting Components

When you delete a component, any associations with status reports and maintenances are automatically removed. The linked monitor (if applicable) is not deleted and remains available in your workspace.

**Warning:** Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Ensure you want to remove the component before confirming deletion.

## Deprecation Notice

The legacy monitor-only system for status pages is deprecated in favor of the more flexible page component system.

**Deprecated approach:**
- Status pages directly referenced monitors.
- No support for static content.
- Limited organizational flexibility.

**Current approach (page components):**
- Status pages contain page components.
- Components can be monitors or static content.
- Full support for grouping and custom ordering.
- Better separation between monitoring and status page presentation.

### API Compatibility

**v1 API (backward compatibility):**
The v1 API continues to display `monitorIds` and `monitors` fields in status page responses to avoid breaking changes for existing integrations. However, these fields now only include page components that are explicitly of type `monitor`. Static components are not included in these legacy fields.

**Future API versions:**
Newer API versions will primarily use the `pageComponents` structure. The legacy `monitors` and `monitorIds` fields will be removed in future API versions. We recommend migrating your integrations to use `pageComponents` for full feature support.
