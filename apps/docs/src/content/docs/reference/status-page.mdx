## Overview

A status page is a dedicated web interface provided by OpenStatus that publicly displays the operational status of your services and systems. It serves as a transparent communication tool during incidents and for showcasing overall service health.

**Key features:**
-   Real-time service status updates.
-   Incident communication and history.
-   Customizable branding and domain.
-   Multiple access control options.

## Configuration

OpenStatus provides several configuration options to customize your status page's appearance, accessibility, and functionality.

### Slug

**Type:** String (required)
**Format:** URL-friendly string (e.g., `my-service-status`)

A unique identifier that forms part of your status page's default URL. For example, a slug of `status` will result in a URL like `https://status.openstatus.dev`.

### Custom Domain

**Type:** String (optional)
**Format:** Valid domain name (e.g., `status.example.com`)

Allows you to host your status page on a custom domain. Once configured, your status page will be accessible at `https://your-custom-domain.com`.

### Password (Basic Auth)

**Type:** String (optional)

Enables basic password protection for your status page. If a password is set, users will be redirected to a login page (`/login`) to gain access. The password is stored in a cookie upon successful authentication.

**Sharing with password:** You can provide direct access by appending the password as a URL search parameter: `https://[slug].openstatus.dev/?pw=your-secret-password`. This method is also useful for authenticating private RSS feeds.

### Magic Link (Session Auth)

**Type:** Boolean (add-on feature)

Restricts access to your status page to users with approved email domains. Users receive a magic link via email, which, upon clicking, authenticates them via a session token. This feature is typically available as a paid add-on for specific plans.

### Favicon

**Type:** Image file (e.g., `.ico`, `.png`)

Allows you to upload a custom favicon that will appear in browser tabs and bookmarks for your status page.

### JSON Feed

**Type:** Read-only endpoint
**Format:** JSON

Provides a machine-readable JSON representation of your status page data. This feed can be accessed by appending `/feed/json` to your status page URL.

**Example:** `https://status.openstatus.dev/feed/json`

### SSH Command

**Type:** Command-line utility

Allows you to quickly check the current status page status directly from your terminal using an SSH command.

**Usage:**

```bash
ssh [slug]@ssh.openstatus.dev
```

**Example:** `ssh my-service@ssh.openstatus.dev`

### White Label

**Type:** Boolean (add-on feature)

Removes the "powered by openstatus.dev" footer from your status page, providing a fully branded experience. This feature is typically available as a paid add-on for Starter and Pro plans and is enabled via your workspace settings, affecting all status pages within that workspace.
