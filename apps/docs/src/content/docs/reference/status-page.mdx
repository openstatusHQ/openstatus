---

A status page is a web page that displays the current status of a service or system.

## Configuration

### Slug

You slug is a unique identifier for your status page. It is used in the URL of your status page. e.g `status` => `https://status.openstatus.dev`

### Custom Domain

You can configure a custom domain for your status page. e.g `status.example.com` => `https://status.example.com`

### Password (basic auth)

You can add a password for your status page to protect a status page. If you are not authenticated, you will get redirected to the `/login`.

The password is stored in plain text in a `cookie`, so keep the password easy and fun. You can share any page by appending the password via the `pw` search param like: `https://[slug].openstatus.dev/?pw=my-secret-password` and we will automatically authenticate the user. This can be useful to authenticate to private RSS feeds.

### Magic Link (session auth)

You can secure your status page by restricting access to users with approved email domains. Users will receive a magic link sent to their email and, upon clicking it, will be authenticated via a session token.

This feature is available as an add-on for paid plans and is not included by default.

### Favicon

You can add a favicon for your status page.


### JSON Feed 

You can access your status page data in JSON format by appending `/feed/json` to your status page URL. 

Example: `https://status.openstatus.dev/feed/json`

### SSH Command

Check the current status page anytime from your Terminal with:

```
ssh [slug]@ssh.openstatus.dev
```

Example: `ssh status@ssh.openstatus.dev`

### White Label

The White Label add-on allows you to remove the "powered by openstatus.dev" footer from your status page, providing a fully branded experience for your users.

This feature is available as a paid add-on for Starter and Pro plans at $300/month. Once enabled in your workspace settings, the OpenStatus branding will be removed from all status pages in your workspace.
