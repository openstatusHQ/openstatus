title: Status Page
---

A status page is a web page that displays the current status of a service or system.

## Configuration

### Slug

You slug is a unique identifier for your status page. It is used in the URL of your status page. e.g `status` => `https://status.openstatus.dev`

### Custom Domain

You can configure a custom domain for your status page. e.g `status.example.com` => `https://status.example.com`

### Password

You can add a password for your status page to protect a status page. If you are not authenticated, you will get redirected to the `/protected`.

The password is stored in plain text in a `cookie`, so keep the password easy and fun. You can share any page by appending the password via the `pw` search param like: `https://custom.stpg.dev/?pw=my-secret-password` and we will automatically authenticate the user. This can be useful to authenticate to private RSS feeds.

> If you need an email confirmed status page, e.g. by whitelisting domains for specific partners who would access the page with a magic link, please contact ping@openstatus.dev - we have that on our backlog and are happy to prioritze it.


### Favicon

You can add a favicon for your status page.
