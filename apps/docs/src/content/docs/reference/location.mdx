## Overview

OpenStatus monitors your endpoints from multiple global locations to ensure accurate uptime and latency reporting. Each monitoring location corresponds to a Fly.io region, with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses available for each.

You can use these locations to:
- Configure region-specific checks
- Allowlist monitoring IPs in your firewall
- Understand where requests originate during synthetic monitoring
