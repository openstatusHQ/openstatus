## Overview

A DNS Monitor is a component designed to verify the availability and correctness of DNS records. It performs periodic lookups for specified DNS record types against a target domain or subdomain from various geographical locations.

**Use cases:**
- Validating domain name resolution
- Monitoring changes to critical DNS records (e.g., A, CNAME, MX)
- Ensuring proper load balancing via DNS (when combined with multi-region checks)
- Detecting unauthorized DNS alterations

## Configuration

### URI

**Type:** String (required)
**Format:** Domain name or subdomain

The fully qualified domain name or subdomain to be monitored.

**Examples:**
- `openstat.us`
- `api.example.com`
- `mail.example.org`

### Record Types

The monitor supports fetching and validating the following DNS record types:

-   `A` (Address Record): Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
-   `AAAA` (IPv6 Address Record): Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
-   `CNAME` (Canonical Name Record): Maps an alias domain name to another canonical domain name.
-   `MX` (Mail Exchange Record): Specifies the mail servers responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name.
-   `NS` (Name Server Record): Delegates a domain or subdomain to a set of authoritative name servers.
-   `TXT` (Text Record): Carries arbitrary human-readable text and is also used for various purposes like SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and site verification.

### Regions

The geographical locations from which the DNS monitoring checks are performed. This allows for verification of DNS propagation and performance across different networks.

### Frequency

The interval at which the DNS checks are performed. Supported frequencies:
- 30 seconds
- 1 minute
- 5 minutes
- 10 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 1 hour

### Response Time Thresholds

#### Timeout

**Type:** Duration (optional)
**Default:** `45 seconds`

The maximum duration to wait for a DNS response. If the lookup exceeds this time, the check is considered failed.

#### Degraded

**Type:** Duration (optional)

The duration after which a DNS response is considered degraded. This indicates a performance issue without being a complete failure.

### Retry

**Type:** Integer (optional)
**Default:** `3`

The number of times the monitor will retry a failed DNS lookup before reporting a definitive failure. For example: `3`
