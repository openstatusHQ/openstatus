A notification is a channel that is used to send alerts when your monitor status changes. By default no notifications are created in your workspace.


## Notification Channels:

### Slack

Require a [Slack incoming webhook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)

### Email

Require an email address

### Discord

Require a [discord webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668
) e.g. `https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/123456789012345678/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890`

### SMS

Require a phone number (international format e.g. +14155552671)

Due to provider routing, SMS may not be delivered to all countries. Please contact support if you encounter any issues. Or use whatsapp notification instead.

### WhatsApp

Require a phone number (international format e.g. +14155552671)


### Telegram

Requires to know the chat id.

> This integration is fully functional but accessing the chat id is not smooth yet. It requires manual effort to access your chat id. **You can ask RawDataBot `@raw_info_bot` for your chat id.**

The bot's id is `@openstatushq_bot` to make sure you are getting the correct notifications.
