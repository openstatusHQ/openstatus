title: About Uptime Monitoring
---

The concept of **uptime monitoring** refers to the practice of continuously checking the availability of a website, server, or application. It's a proactive measure that alerts you to problems as they happen, helping to minimize downtime and its potential negative impacts.

## Key Concepts

- **Downtime**: The period when a service is unavailable or not functioning as expected. It can be caused by server failures, network issues, software bugs, or even cyberattacks.

- **Uptime**: The percentage of time a service is available and operational. A high uptime percentage (e.g., 99.9% or "three nines") indicates reliability.

- **Alerting**: The system of notifying a team or individual when downtime is detected. Alerts can be sent via email, SMS, Slack, or other communication channels.

## Why Uptime Monitoring is Crucial

- **Business Continuity**: Downtime can lead to significant financial losses, damage to reputation, and loss of customer trust. Uptime monitoring helps you address issues quickly, ensuring your services are always available to your users.

- **Performance Insight**: Monitoring tools often provide data on latency and response times, giving you insights into your service's performance beyond just availability. This can help you optimize your infrastructure and user experience.

- **Proactive Problem Solving**: Instead of waiting for a customer to report an issue, uptime monitoring allows you to be the first to know about it. This enables you to troubleshoot and resolve problems before they escalate.

## How it Works

Uptime monitoring typically involves a monitoring agent that periodically sends a request (like an HTTP GET request) to your service.

- If the service responds with a successful status code (e.g., 200 OK), it's considered up.

- If the service returns an error code, a timeout, or no response, the agent will perform a re-check from a different location to confirm the outage. This helps prevent false alarms caused by temporary network glitches.

- Upon confirmation, the system triggers an alert, notifying the relevant team members. The monitoring system will continue to check the service until it's back online, at which point a recovery alert is often sent.

Common types of checks include:

- **HTTP/HTTPS checks:** Verify a website is accessible and returns a valid response.
- **TCP checks:** Confirm a server is reachable on the network.



## Planning an Uptime Monitoring System

When planning your own uptime monitoring system, consider the following:

1.  Define What to Monitor: Identify all critical services, websites, APIs, and servers that need to be monitored. Prioritize based on business impact.

2. Select a Monitoring Tool: Choose a tool that fits your needs. Options range from simple free services to complex enterprise-level platforms. Look for features like:

    - **Multiple locations:** Checks from various geographic regions to ensure global availability.

    - **Customizable alerting:** Set up different alert thresholds and notification methods.

    - **Reporting and dashboards:** Visualize uptime history, performance metrics, and incident reports.

    - **Integrations:** Connect with your existing tools like Slack, PagerDuty, or email.

3. **Establish Alerting Rules:** Determine who should be notified and when. Set up an escalation policyâ€”for example, if a primary on-call engineer doesn't respond within 15 minutes, the alert is sent to a manager.

4. **Regularly Review and Optimize:** Monitor your monitoring system itself. Review historical data to identify recurring issues, fine-tune alert thresholds, and update your list of monitored services as your infrastructure evolves.
