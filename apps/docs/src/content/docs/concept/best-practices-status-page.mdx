## The purpose of a status page

A status page is more than just a dashboard of green lights. It's a critical tool for communication and a cornerstone of building trust with your users. Its primary purpose is to provide a single, authoritative source of truth about your service's health and any ongoing incidents.

When done right, a status page:
- **Reduces support burden**: Users can self-serve information about outages instead of contacting your team.
- **Builds trust**: Proactive transparency, even when things go wrong, demonstrates accountability.
- **Improves communication**: It provides a central and consistent channel for incident updates.
- **Demonstrates professionalism**: It shows that you take reliability and user experience seriously.

This article explores the principles that make a status page an effective tool for building trust.

## Principles of Effective Status Pages

### Maintain Transparency and Honesty

A status page's effectiveness hinges on being a reliable source of truth. Be upfront about issues, even minor ones. Hiding problems erodes user trust and can lead to frustration and a higher support load.

- **Communicate Clearly:** Use simple, non-technical language. Your users shouldn't need a technical dictionary to understand the impact of an issue.

- **Be Timely:** Update the page as soon as an incident is confirmed. Provide regular, predictable updates throughout the resolution process, even if the only update is "we're still working on it."

### Automate Where Possible

Manual updates during a high-stress outage are prone to error and can be slow. Automation ensures that your status page reflects reality quickly and accurately.

- **Integrate Monitoring Tools:** Your status page should be directly connected to your internal monitoring and alerting systems. When a metric crosses a threshold (e.g., a high error rate), the status page can be updated automatically to reflect a degraded state.

- **Use an API:** We provide APIs that allow you to programmatically update component statuses and post new incidents, integrating your status page into your incident response workflows.


### Provide Context-Rich Incident Communication

When an incident occurs, a structured narrative helps users understand the situation.

- **Start with the Impact:** Clearly and concisely state what the problem is from the user's perspective. For example, "Users are currently unable to log in."

- **Explain the Cause (When Known):** Briefly explain the root cause if you've identified it. Transparency here is key.

- **Outline Next Steps and ETA:** Explain what is being done to resolve the issue and provide an estimated time to resolution if possible. It's better to give a conservative estimate or no estimate than to give one you can't meet.

A typical incident communication lifecycle looks like this:

- **Investigating:** "We're currently investigating an issue affecting user logins."

- **Identified:** "We've identified the root cause as a database connection issue and are working on a fix."

- **Monitoring:** "A fix has been deployed, and we're monitoring the system to ensure stability."

- **Resolved:** "The issue has been resolved. We will publish a post-mortem within 48 hours."


### Ensure Easy Accessibility

Your status page is useless if no one can find it.

- **Prominent Link:** Link to your status page from your application's footer, your main website, and your support documentation.

- **Custom Domain:** Use a simple, memorable URL like `status.yourcompany.com`.

## Advanced Considerations for Deeper Trust

### Scheduled Maintenance

Communicating planned downtime is just as important as communicating unexpected incidents.
- Announce maintenance well in advance (e.g., at least 72 hours).
- Display upcoming maintenance windows clearly on the status page.
- Send reminders to subscribers before maintenance begins.

### Historical Data and Post-Mortems

Demonstrate your commitment to reliability by being open about your track record.
- Display historical uptime percentages (e.g., over the last 30/60/90 days).
- Link to past incidents and their post-mortems. Being honest about past failures and what you've learned from them is a powerful trust-builder.

### Subscriber Notifications

Allow users to opt-in to the level of communication they want.
- Email notifications for new incidents and resolutions.
- SMS for critical alerts (if applicable).
- RSS/Atom feeds for users who want to integrate your status into their own monitoring.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Claiming unrealistic uptime**: Don't claim 100% uptime unless you can back it up. Honesty is better than perfection.
2. **Hiding or downplaying incidents**: Users will find out anyway. It's better they hear it from you.
3. **Using technical jargon**: Write for a broad audience, not just other engineers.
4. **Leaving users in the dark**: During an incident, regular updates are crucial, even if there's no new information. A simple "still investigating" is better than silence.
5. **Hosting your status page on the same infrastructure**: Your status page must be available even when your main service is down.
