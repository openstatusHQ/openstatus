title: Uptime Calculation and Shared Values
---

Let’s face it - uptime values can be a complete lie if they’re not properly connected to monitoring.

We want to make uptime transparent and configurable. You decide how your uptime is calculated and which values you want to share on your status page.
When monitoring an endpoint, a check can end up in one of three states:

- ✅ Success – everything’s fine
- ⚠️ Degraded – slow or partially failing
- ❌ Down – no response or full failure

We now offer multiple types of uptime calculation:
- **Absolute** (default): derived directly from your monitoring data
    - **Duration**: aggregated from the incidents duration
    - **Requests** (default): aggregated from the request values
- **Manual**: for teams that prefer full control over what’s shown

**TL;DR**

| Type        | Source of Truth      | What Users See                      | Best For                        |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Duration** (Absolute) | Incident duration    | Time based uptime, proportional colors | Accurate long-term view         |
| **Request** (Absolute)  | Every ping result    | Request-based uptime %              | Real-time reflection            |
| **Manual**   | Manually set status  | Controlled, narrative updates       | Transparency without monitoring |

<br />

Let’s break them down!

## Absolute Type

The absolute type calculates uptime based on actual monitoring results. It’s the most accurate reflection of what’s really happening, and comes in two variants: _Duration_ and _Request_.
Both of these share real data with your users - incidents, degraded states, and historical uptime - but they differ in how they aggregate and display that data.

### Duration

The duration value is calculated from the **total monitoring time and the duration of incidents**.

In simple terms: `uptime = (total time - incident duration) / total time`

This means uptime is based on how long something was down, not how many checks failed. Only incident durations are included in the calculation. 

Temporary single-region ping failures (e.g., one location failing once, sometimes this just happens) are not propagated to users - because these often don’t represent a real outage. That’s also why we recommend at least three locations per monitor for redundancy. 

The proportional colors in the status bar are drawn from these duration values. Hovering over a day shows both incidents and status reports, so users can explore what happened.

### Request

The request value is more straightforward - it looks at each ping result individually. **Every check we run contributes to your uptime score**.

In simple terms: `uptime = (success + degraded - error) / total requests`

This is the current default mode for most openstatus users. It’s simple, data-driven, and updates immediately as new results come in. 

Like with duration, hover cards display incidents and status reports, giving your users a quick overview of recent events.

## Manual Type

The manual type is for teams who want to **fully control what’s shown** on your status page, without relying on automatic checks.
By default, your monitor is marked operational. You can then manually create status reports whenever you want to reflect changes - independent of any monitoring data.

This is ideal if:
- you don’t have synthetic monitoring set up yet,
- or you’re sharing updates that aren’t tied to uptime (e.g., service degradation due to external dependencies).

In this mode, all displayed uptime values and statuses come from your shared report data, not from active pings.

In simple terms: `uptime = (total duration - status report duration) / total duration`

> **Note**: the values you are defining are attached to a status page. You cannot change them per monitor (for now).
