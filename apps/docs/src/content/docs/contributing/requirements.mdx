  [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest or LTS
  version (18.0.0 or above). Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.

- For Linux, you can use a package manager
  ([nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git/)) or download the binaries from the
  official Node.js website. For example, using the package manager `apt` on
  Ubuntu:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nodejs
  ```

  Ensure that the installed version is 18.0.0 or above:

  ```bash
  node --version
  ```

terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
