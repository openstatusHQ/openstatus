This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first monitor, your automated watchdog for your services. A monitor periodically checks your endpoints to ensure they are available, performant, and returning the correct data. Think of it as a `curl` command that runs 24/7, providing continuous insights into the health of your application.


## Get Started in 1 Minute

Let's get your first uptime check up and running.

### 1. Create the Monitor

  <Image
    src={createMonitor}
    alt="Charts with status code and response time"
  />

Navigate to the **Monitors** page from the sidebar and click the **Create Monitor** button. This will open a new configuration screen.


### 2. Configure the Basics

  />

To get your monitor started, you only need to provide two essential pieces of information:
- **Name:** A clear, descriptive name for your monitor (e.g., "Production API Health Check" or "Homepage Uptime").
- **URL:** The full URL of the endpoint you want to test (e.g., `https://openstat.us`).

As soon as you enter the URL, our monitoring tool will automatically begin tracking key performance metrics for every check, including:
- **Response Time:** The total time it takes for the request to complete.
- **Status Code:** The HTTP status code returned by the server (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
- **Response Headers:** A detailed view of the headers returned by the server.
- **Detailed Timing Metrics:** A breakdown of the time spent on each phase of the request (DNS lookup, TCP connection, TLS handshake, etc.)

### 3. Customizing the HTTP Request

Your monitor doesn't just have to be a simple `GET` request. You can customize the HTTP request to simulate real-world traffic and test specific scenarios.

#### HTTP Method

Choose the appropriate HTTP method for your check. While `GET` is the default and most common for simple health checks, you can also select `POST`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `TRACE`. `OPTIONS`

- `GET`: Retrieve data from an endpoint. The most common choice for health checks.
- `POST`: Send data to an endpoint, for example, to test a form submission or API creation endpoint.
- `HEAD`: Same as `GET`, but without the response body. Useful for quickly checking if a resource exists.
- `OPTIONS`: Retrieve the supported HTTP methods for a resource.
- `PUT`: Update an existing resource.
- `PATCH`: Partially update an existing resource.
- `DELETE`: Delete a resource.
- `TRACE`: Echo the request back to the client.

#### Request Body

If you select the `POST` method, you can add a Request Body to your monitor's configuration. This is essential for testing API endpoints that require a JSON, form-encoded, or other data payload. Simply enter the data you want to send in the provided text area.

#### Custom Headers

You can add any number of custom HTTP headers to your request. This is particularly useful for:

- **Authentication:**: Sending an Authorization token (e.g., a Bearer token) to test a protected endpoint.
- **Content Type:**: Setting an `content-type` header  to specify a content type (e.g., `application/json`).
- **Content Negotiation:** Setting an Accept header to request a specific content type from the server (e.g., `application/json`).
- **Simulating Clients:** Adding a User-Agent header to simulate traffic from a specific browser or device.

    Heads Up: We've got your User-Agent covered!
    OpenStatus automatically includes the `"User-Agent": "OpenStatus/1.0"` header in every request. This makes it easy to identify and filter out our monitoring traffic from your server logs or analytics.



## Fine-Tuning Your Monitor ⚙️

Once you've configured the basics, you can further refine your monitor's behavior with these advanced options:

        href="/monitoring/customization/assertions"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Frequency"
        href="/monitoring/customization/frequency"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Locations"
        href="/monitoring/customization/locations"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Timing"
        href="/monitoring/customization/timing"
    />
</CardGrid>



## Important Considerations
### Monitoring Third-Party Endpoints
<Aside>If you're monitoring a URL you don't own (like `google.com` or a partner API), your requests might be blocked by firewalls or rate limiters (e.g., Cloudflare). This is a security measure on their end to prevent scraping or denial-of-service attacks.</Aside>
