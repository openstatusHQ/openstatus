## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create your first monitor an automated watchdog for your services. A monitor periodically checks your endpoints to ensure they are available, performant, and returning the correct data. Think of it as a `curl` command that runs 24/7, providing continuous insights into the health of your application.

### Prerequisites

- An openstatus account (free tier available at [openstatus.dev](https://www.openstatus.dev))
- A URL endpoint to monitor (can be your own service or any public URL)

### What you'll build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- A working uptime monitor checking your endpoint every minute
- Real-time metrics showing response time and status codes
- Understanding of how to customize HTTP requests for different scenarios


## Get Started in 1 Minute

Let's get your first uptime check up and running.

### 1. Create the Monitor

  <Image
    src={createMonitor}
    alt="Charts with status code and response time"
  />

Navigate to the **Monitors** page from the sidebar and click the **Create Monitor** button. This will open a new configuration screen.


### 2. Configure the Basics

  <Image
    src={createMonitor2}
    alt="Charts with status code and response time"
  />

To get your monitor started, you only need to provide two essential pieces of information:
- **Name:** A clear, descriptive name for your monitor (e.g., "Production API Health Check" or "Homepage Uptime").
- **URL:** The full URL of the endpoint you want to test (e.g., `https://openstat.us`).

As soon as you enter the URL, our monitoring tool will automatically begin tracking key performance metrics for every check, including:
- **Response Time:** The total time it takes for the request to complete.
- **Status Code:** The HTTP status code returned by the server (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
- **Response Headers:** A detailed view of the headers returned by the server.
- **Detailed Timing Metrics:** A breakdown of the time spent on each phase of the request (DNS lookup, TCP connection, TLS handshake, etc.)

### 3. Customizing the HTTP Request

Your monitor doesn't just have to be a simple `GET` request. You can customize the HTTP request to simulate real-world traffic and test specific scenarios.

#### HTTP Method

Choose the appropriate HTTP method for your check. While `GET` is the default and most common for simple health checks, you can also select `POST`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `TRACE`. `OPTIONS`

- `GET`: Retrieve data from an endpoint. The most common choice for health checks.
- `POST`: Send data to an endpoint, for example, to test a form submission or API creation endpoint.
- `HEAD`: Same as `GET`, but without the response body. Useful for quickly checking if a resource exists.
- `OPTIONS`: Retrieve the supported HTTP methods for a resource.
- `PUT`: Update an existing resource.
- `PATCH`: Partially update an existing resource.
- `DELETE`: Delete a resource.
- `TRACE`: Echo the request back to the client.

#### Request Body

If you select the `POST` method, you can add a Request Body to your monitor's configuration. This is essential for testing API endpoints that require a JSON, form-encoded, or other data payload. Simply enter the data you want to send in the provided text area.

#### Custom Headers

You can add any number of custom HTTP headers to your request. This is particularly useful for:

- **Authentication:**: Sending an Authorization token (e.g., a Bearer token) to test a protected endpoint.
- **Content Type:**: Setting an `content-type` header  to specify a content type (e.g., `application/json`).
- **Content Negotiation:** Setting an Accept header to request a specific content type from the server (e.g., `application/json`).
- **Simulating Clients:** Adding a User-Agent header to simulate traffic from a specific browser or device.

    Heads Up: We've got your User-Agent covered!
    openstatus automatically includes the `"User-Agent": "openstatus/1.0"` header in every request. This makes it easy to identify and filter out our monitoring traffic from your server logs or analytics.




## Important Considerations
### Monitoring Third-Party Endpoints
<Aside>If you're monitoring a URL you don't own (like `google.com` or a partner API), your requests might be blocked by firewalls or rate limiters (e.g., Cloudflare). This is a security measure on their end to prevent scraping or denial-of-service attacks.</Aside>

## What you've accomplished

Congratulations! You've successfully:
- ✅ Created your first uptime monitor
- ✅ Configured basic HTTP monitoring settings
- ✅ Learned about customizing requests with methods, headers, and body
- ✅ Understood key monitoring metrics (response time, status codes, timing breakdown)

## What's next?

Now that you have a monitor running, you can:

- **[Create a Status Page](/tutorial/how-to-create-status-page)** - Share your service status publicly with users
- **[Set Up Alerting](/monitoring/customization/notification)** - Get notified when your service goes down
- **[Configure Assertions](/monitoring/customization/assertions)** - Validate response content, not just status codes
- **[Add Multiple Regions](/monitoring/customization/locations)** - Monitor from different global locations
