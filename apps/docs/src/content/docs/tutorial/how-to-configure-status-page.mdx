## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to customize your status page's appearance and behavior. You'll explore different display options, themes, and configuration settings to create a status page that matches your brand and communication style.

### Prerequisites

- An openstatus account
- A status page already created (see [Create a Status Page](/tutorial/how-to-create-status-page))
- At least one monitor added to your status page

### What you'll build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- A customized status page with your preferred theme
- Configured status trackers displaying data your way
- Links to important resources
- Preview and live configuration experience

## Status Page Redesign (Beta)

We are releasing a new version of our status pages with enhanced customization options.

Explore available themes: [https://themes.openstatus.dev](https://themes.openstatus.dev)

## Get started

Go to the **Status Page Redesign (beta)** section in your status page settings. Toggle the `Enable New Version` to support it. Once enabled, you'll see two subsections:

1. **Tracker Configuration**
2. **Theme Explorer**
2. **Links**

<Image
    src={ConfigureStatusPage1}
    alt="Create your status page"
/>

### View and configure status page

Before choosing to enable the new page, we provide you with a way to check the configuration first. Click on the **View and configure status page** and you'll get forwarded to your status page and a bottom right floating button will appear. Once you're done, click on the **Dashboard** and you'll be forwarded to your page where you get asked to save the config before continuing.

<Aside>Once enabled, the subdomain will have a rewrite to the new project. We are adding a `maxAge: 600` request cookie to improve the page load. **If you decide to deactivate the new version, it might take up to 10 minutes for the user to see the old page.**</Aside>

### 1. Tracker Configuration

We have three new status tracker configurations to provide you with a maximum choice of displaying the collected data.

**Bar Type**: How every 'day' is displayed in for a status tracker. Either **absolute** or **manual**.

**Card Type**: The card type is only configurable if the bar type is **absolute**. You'll then be able to choose between **duration**, which will show the duration of "success", "error", "degraded" or "maintenance" reports or **requests** where we will share the number of request status itself. If **manual** bar type is chosen, we will only show the most significant status of the day.

**Show Uptime**: The uptime is calculated by ither the **duration** of the different reports _or_ the **request** values depending on what you've chosen for the **absolute** value (incl. incidents). If you've chosen **manual**, it only gets calculated by the duration of your status reports.

A few examples to understand it:

Example of **absolute bar** with **duration card** and **showing uptime**

<Image
    src={StatusPageBeta3}
    alt="absolute bar type with duration card and showing uptime"
/>

Example of **absolute bar** with **request card** and **hiding uptime**

<Image
    src={StatusPageBeta4}
    alt="absolute bar type with request card and hiding uptime"
/>

Example of **manual bar** with **simple card** and **hiding uptime**

<Image
    src={StatusPageBeta2}
    alt="manual bar type and hiding uptime"
/>

### 2. Theme Explorer

You can choose between different themes. We start with the following three:

- `default` (openstatus)
- `supabase`
- `github-high-contrast`

Visit [themes.openstatus.dev](https://themes.openstatus.dev) to see the list of supported themes. If you want, you can contribute your own to the list.

### 3. Links

Let's have a closer look to your status page header navigation:

<Image
    src={StatusPageBeta1}
    alt="Header navigation of your status page"
/>

**Homepage URL**: Your logo will support linking to your own website.

**Contact URL**: If filled out, you will see a `Message` icon that users can click to forward them to a contact page. This can also be an email client by starting the input with `mailto:` (e.g. `mailto:support@openstatus.dev`).
