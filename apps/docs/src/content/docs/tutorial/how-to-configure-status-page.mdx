We are releasing a new version of our status pages.

<Aside>This is an **opt-in toggle**. We will keep the current status page until next year to allow you migrate or provide any feedback.</Aside>

You can always have a look how your status page will look like via `https://[slug].stpg.dev`.

Example: https://status.stpg.dev

## Get started

Go to the **Status Page Redesign (beta)** section in your status page settings. Toggle the `Enable New Version` to support it. Once enabled, you'll see two subsections:

1. **Tracker Configuration**
2. **Links**

<Image
    src={ConfigureStatusPage1}
    alt="Create your status page"
/>

<Aside>Once enabled, the subdomain will have a rewrite to the new project. We are adding a `maxAge: 600` request cookie to improve the page load. If you decide to deactivate the new version, it might take up to 10min. for the user to see the old page.</Aside>

### 1. Tracker Configuration

We have three new status tracker configurations to provide you with a maximum choice of displaying the collected data.

**Bar Type**: How every 'day' is displayed in for a status tracker. Either **absolute** or **manual**.

**Card Type**: The card type is only configurable if the bar type is **absolute**. You'll then be able to choose between **duration**, which will show the duration of "success", "error", "degraded" or "maintenance" reports or **requests** where we will share the number of request status itself. If **manual** bar type is chosen, we will only show the most significant status of the day.

**Show Uptime**: The uptime is calculated by ither the **duration** of the different reports _or_ the **request** values depending on what you've chosen for the **absolute** value (incl. incidents). If you've chosen **manual**, it only gets calculated by the duration of your status reports.

A few examples to understand it:

Example of **absolute bar** with **duration card** and **showing uptime**

<Image
    src={StatusPageBeta3}
    alt="absolute bar type with duration card and showing uptime"
/>

Example of **absolute bar** with **request card** and **hiding uptime**

<Image
    src={StatusPageBeta4}
    alt="absolute bar type with request card and hiding uptime"
/>

Example of **manual bar** with **simple card** and **hiding uptime**

<Image
    src={StatusPageBeta2}
    alt="manual bar type and hiding uptime"
/>

### 2. Links

Let's have a closer look to your status page header navigation:

<Image
    src={StatusPageBeta1}
    alt="Header navigation of your status page"
/>

**Homepage URL**: Your logo will support linking to your own website.

**Contact URL**: If filled out, you will see a `Message` icon that users can click to forward them to a contact page. This can also be an email client by starting the input with `mailto:` (e.g. `mailto:support@openstatus.dev`).
