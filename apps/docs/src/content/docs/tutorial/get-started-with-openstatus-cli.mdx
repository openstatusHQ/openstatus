## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use the OpenStatus CLI to manage your monitors as code. This enables you to version control your monitoring configuration, automate deployments, and implement GitOps workflows.

### Prerequisites

- An OpenStatus account
- Command line experience
- API token from your OpenStatus workspace (Settings → API)

### What you'll build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- OpenStatus CLI installed on your system
- Monitors exported to a YAML configuration file
- Understanding of monitoring as code workflows
- Ability to manage monitors programmatically

## Installation

Install the OpenStatus CLI to manage your monitors directly from code.

### macOS

Using Homebrew (recommended):
```bash
brew install openstatusHQ/cli/openstatus --cask
```

Or using the install script:
```bash
curl -sSL instl.sh/openstatushq/cli/macos | bash
```

### Linux

```bash
curl -sSL instl.sh/openstatushq/cli/linux | bash
```

### Windows

```bash
iwr instl.sh/openstatushq/cli/windows | iex
```

## Configure API authentication

Create an API key in your workspace settings (Settings → API), then set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENSTATUS_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token>
```

**Tip**: Add this to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) to persist across sessions.

## Import existing monitors

Start by importing your existing monitors from your workspace to a YAML file:

```bash
openstatus monitors import
```

This creates an `openstatus.yaml` file containing all your current monitors. This file becomes your single source of truth for monitoring configuration.

## Manage monitors as code

Now you can add, remove, or update monitors in the YAML file and apply your changes:

```bash
openstatus monitors apply
```

The CLI will show you a diff of changes before applying them, ensuring you're aware of what will be modified.

## What you've accomplished

Excellent work! You've successfully:
- ✅ Installed the OpenStatus CLI
- ✅ Configured API authentication
- ✅ Imported monitors to a YAML file
- ✅ Learned the monitoring as code workflow

## What's next?

Now that you have the CLI set up, you can:
