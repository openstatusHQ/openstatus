## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, you'll create a public status page to communicate your service's health to users. A status page is a transparent way to show real-time uptime information and keep your users informed during incidents.

### Prerequisites

- An openstatus account
- At least one monitor created (see [Create Your First Monitor](/tutorial/how-to-create-monitor))

### What you'll build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- A public status page showing your service health
- Monitors displayed on your status page
- Understanding of privacy and security options

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a status page in openstatus. A status page is a web page that displays the status of your services, building trust with your users through transparency.

## Get started

### 1. Create the status page

Navigate to the **Status Pages** page from the sidebar and click the **Create Status Page** button. This will open a new configuration screen.

    src={CreateStatusPage1}
    alt="Create your status page"
/>


### 2. Configure the status page

After creating the status page, you can configure it



<Image
    src={CreateStatusPage2}
    alt="Configure your status page"
/>

#### Monitors

You need to add monitors to your status page. Monitors are used to check the status of your services.

#### Custom domain

You can add a Custom Domain to your status page. Custom domains allow you to use your own domain name instead of the default domain name provided by openstatus.


#### Password Protection

You can add password protection to your status page. Password protection allows you to restrict access to your status page to only authorized users.

## What you've accomplished

Great work! You've successfully:
- ✅ Created your first status page
- ✅ Added monitors to display service health
- ✅ Learned about custom domains and password protection
