## PNG Badge

```html
<img src='https://[slug].openstatus.dev/badge'>
```

This will return a PNG image with the status of your page. It will look like this:
<img src='https://status.openstatus.dev/badge' />

You can customize the theme by adding `?theme=dark` and the size of it by adding `?size=lg`.

Supported themes:
- `dark`
- `light` (default)

Supported sizes:
- `sm` (default)
- `md`
- `lg`
- `xl`

It will display the following labels based on the current status of the status page:

```

## SVG Badge (v2)

```html
<img src='https://[slug].openstatus.dev/badge/v2'>
```

This will return a PNG image with the status of your page. It will look like this:
<img src='https://status.openstatus.dev/badge/v2' />

You can customize the theme by adding `?theme=dark`, the size of it by adding `?size=lg` and the variant `?variant=outline` - use what fits best to you!

Supported themes:
- `light` (default)
- `dark`

Supported sizes:
- `sm` (default)
- `md`
- `lg`
- `xl`

Supported variants:
- `default` (default)
- `outline`

The **outline** variant simply adds a slightly rounded border to the svg `rect`. It mainly can be used for GitHub README or Markdown where styling is not supported.

Compared to the PNG badge, we let you define the `border` and `border-radius` of the SVG badge and the font is mono.

It will display the following labels based on the current status of the status page:

```
All Systems Operational
Degraded Performance
Partial Outage
Major Outage
Ongoing Incident
Under Maintenance
Unknown
```
