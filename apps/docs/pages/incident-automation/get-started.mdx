# What is incident automation? 🤔

When you have an incident, you might need to perform a series of actions to
handle it. For example, you might need to:

- create a slack channel
- create a google meet meeting
- create a Linear ticket
- Perform a checklist of actions

Incident automation allows you to automate these actions.
