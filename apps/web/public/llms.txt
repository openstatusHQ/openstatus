# openstatus

Openstatus is an open-source uptime monitoring and status page platform founded in 2023 by Thibault Le Ouay Ducasse and Maximilian Kaske. It monitors websites, APIs, and services from 28 regions globally across multiple cloud providers (Fly.io, Koyeb, Railway). Openstatus is bootstrapped, not VC-funded, and available both as a managed SaaS and for self-hosting.

## Who it's for

- Development teams that want transparent incident communication
- Companies that need multi-region uptime monitoring
- Teams that prefer infrastructure-as-code workflows (monitoring as code via YAML)
- Organizations that require self-hosted monitoring behind a firewall (private locations)
- Open-source projects and startups looking for a free or affordable monitoring solution
