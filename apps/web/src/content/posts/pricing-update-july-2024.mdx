It's been six months since our last pricing update, and a lot has changed. We've shipped a lot of new features  since January significantly improving our product, e.g :
- [35 regions available](/changelog/more-regions),
- [Password protected status page](/changelog/password-protected-status-page),
- [PagerDuty integrations](/changelog/pagerduty-integration)


In light of these improvements, we realized our pricing needed a refresh to accurately reflect the current value we're providing to our users.

Let's dive into the details of our update and why it matters.

**We have grandfathered all our existing customers into the previous pricing, so this update only affects new customers. For the free users if you want to keep your old limit just [book](https://cal.com/team/openstatus/15min) a call with us.**

## 🫳 9 We Dropped the 9: Embracing Clean Pricing

You may notice something unusual in our new pricing structure: the absence of prices ending in 9 This isn't a random choice, but a deliberate step towards more transparent and honest pricing.

The psychology behind pricing is fascinating. Research by [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/blog/end-prices-in-9s) reveals that while prices ending in 9 can boost sales, it's a common practice accross all industry. They're often associated with discount brands or perceived as a marketing ploy. By embracing round numbers, we're making a statement about our product's quality and value. We're not trying to create an illusion of a bargain; instead, we're confidently presenting our true worth.

## 🌍💰More Regions, Lower Price

We're proud to say that even with our updated pricing, we remain more affordable than our competitors while offering more regions. Here's a quick comparison:

We currently support `35 regions`, and plans to expand to `41 regions` soon.

Our main competitor, Datadog, only covers `29 regions`. They also charge per request `$7.20 per 10k requests`, which can quickly add up if you're monitoring multiple services.

We took a completly different approach we are charging per monitors instead of requests. You can still run some checks via our [API](https://api.openstatus.dev/v1#tag/monitor/POST/monitor/:id/trigger) if you need to.

This means you can set a fixed number of monitors without worrying about the number of requests our price is fixed.

You can see how many requests you can do with a monitor:

## 🏠💸 The Cost of Self-Hosting.

Some of you might be wondering, "Could I save money by hosting this myself?" Let's break it down.

Our checker is built in Go, making it incredibly lightweight and resource-efficient.
Unlike most of our competitors who use Node-based checkers and/or Playwright, our solution can handle millions of requests on small machines.
Plus, Golang's networking package is unparalleled for handling various network checks (with DNS, TCP, and ICMP support coming soon).

If you were to host our checker yourself across the same number of regions we cover, here's a rough cost estimate:

```
35 (Number of Fly Regions) * $3 (Average price per Fly Machine) = $105 per month
```


And that's just for hosting.

It doesn't account for the time and expertise required to manage and maintain the system across all these regions.

But you can get it for $30 with our `Starter` plan.

## 🔄💰 Why Regular Pricing Updates Matter

Updating pricing regularly is crucial for any startup. It's a way to gauge how users value the product and ensure the business model remains sustainable as the product evolves.

Valuing a product correctly is one of the most challenging tasks for any team.
It requires a delicate balance between providing value to users and ensuring the company can continue to innovate and grow.

## Conclusion


Our pricing update reflects the significant improvements we've made to our product over the past six months.

This pricing allows us to continue providing top-notch service across more regions than our competitors, all while keeping costs manageable for our users.

We believe in transparency, which is why we've shared these insights into our pricing strategy.

Our goal is to continue providing you with the best monitoring service.
