At OpenStatus, we offer **global monitoring** to give you an unbiased, external view of your service's performance. To truly test our monitoring capabilities and gather real-world latency data, we decided to benchmark a simple application deployed outside our internal network.


As a software developer, I know that **latency** is critical for user experience. When building an application, understanding how your app performs from different locations around the world is essential.

## The Benchmark Setup

To prevent internal networking biases from skewing the results, I deployed a minimal test application a [**Hono server**](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/status-code/) on third-party cloud providers, independent from OpenStatus's infrastructure.

### Why Hetzner?

I chose **Hetzner** for this experiment primarily for its **affordability** and robust infrastructure. It’s a popular choice for developers, making it a relevant target for benchmarking.

The test app is a single instance deployed in their **Finland datacenter**.

> ⚠️ **A Note on Deployment Experience:** The initial setup experience with Hetzner involved some friction, including KYC verification, which felt a bit dated. To manage the deployment, I opted to use **Coolify Cloud**, which helped bridge the gap, but the inner developer in me definitely missed the simplicity of a managed **PaaS** during the process.

##  Monitoring Strategy with OpenStatus

The core of this experiment is to see how different cloud providers' network paths affect the latency to our Finland-based Hetzner app.

We've set up OpenStatus probes across multiple continents and providers, specifically leveraging monitoring locations from:

- **Fly.io**
- **Koyeb**
- **Railway**

The goal is to monitor latency from similar geographic regions across these different providers to observe any network path variations.


### OpenStatus Probe Configuration

Our monitoring strategy is focused on diverse, yet regionally comparable, deployment regions:

| Location          | Providers           |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Frankfurt         | Koyeb, Fly          |
| Amsterdam         | Fly, Railway        |
| Paris             | Koyeb, Fly          |
| US East           | Koyeb, Fly, Railway |
| US West (LAX/SFO) | Koyeb, Fly, Railway |
| Singapore         | Koyeb, Fly, Railway |
| Tokyo             | Koyeb, Fly          |


I have defined our monitor with the openstatus cli, and this is the exact configuration used for it :


```yaml
"hetzner-monitoring":
  active: true
  assertions:
  - compare: eq
    kind: statusCode
    target: 200
  frequency: 1m
  kind: http
  name: Hetzner Monitoring
  openTelemetry: {}
  public: true
  regions:
  - koyeb_fra
  - cdg
  - ams
  - railway_europe-west4-drams3a
  - fra
  - koyeb_par
  - koyeb_sfo
  - railway_us-west2
  - lax
  - iad
  - koyeb_was
  - railway_us-east4-eqdc4a
  - koyeb_sin
  - railway_asia-southeast1-eqsg3a
  - koyeb_tyo
  - sin
  - nrt
  request:
    method: GET
    url: https://hetzner.openstat.us/
  retry: 3
```

Note that non prefixed regions are Fly regions.

#### 1. Regional Consistency Across Providers

In regions geographically close to the Hetzner Finland datacenter, probes deployed on different cloud providers showed remarkably similar performance.

For instance, from **Frankfurt, Germany**:

- The latency from the **Koyeb** probe and the **Fly** probe had an almost identical **P95 latency of ≈80ms**.

This indicates that in proximate locations, the difference in the cloud provider's network path to the target server is minimal; the dominant factor is the geographical distance and core internet routing.

#### 2. Distance is the Primary Factor

The most significant finding reinforces a basic network principle: **the further you are from the server location, the longer the latency is.**

#### 3. Consistency Even at Extreme Distance

Even across vast distances, the latency differences between providers remained small.

In **Singapore**, for example, the probes from **Fly**, **Koyeb**, and **Railway** all reported very similar latencies, often with **less than a 10% difference** between their average results. This suggests that while all are far, none of the providers offer a vastly superior or inferior route for transcontinental communication in this case.


## Conclusion

Through this global setup, I gained valuable insights into external network performance. I confirmed that the core challenge remains **geographic distance**, but the multi-provider approach helped us establish a **reliable baseline** for external connections. Developers can use this methodology to move past internal network bias and truly understand their app's latency profile from various points on the globe.

My 2cts, if you want to pick a PaaS to deploy your next project, pick the one that fits your needs the best, because in the end, the network differences are minimal!
