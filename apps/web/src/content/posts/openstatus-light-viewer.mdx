A few months ago, we released [light.openstatus.dev](https://light.openstatus.dev) (`vercel-edge-ping`) - a lightweight community edition of OpenStatus designed to monitor your `HTTP` endpoints via Vercel's edge regions and notify you if `>50%` of the requests go down. No dependencies, no UI, just the essentials. For more details, check out our [README](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/vercel-edge-ping).

Now, we’re excited to announce support for an extensive dashboard. If you're already using Tinybird to store your data, simply redeploy the latest `vercel-edge-ping` project and include the updated [pipes](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/vercel-edge-ping/tree/main/tb/pipes) in Tinybird. You can then access your values via [logs.run/light](https://logs.run/light) by updating the base URL of the API endpoint (use the floating button in the bottom left corner). By default, it will display demo values from [light.openstatus.dev](https://light.openstatus.dev).

### Folder Structure

For everyone who wants to build their own dashboard, here's a snapshot of the current **Folder Structure**:

```json
/src/app/light
├── api
│   └── route.tsx
├── client.tsx
├── columns.tsx
├── constants.tsx
├── layout.tsx
├── page.tsx
├── query-options.ts
└── search-params.ts
```

- **`client.tsx`**: Client component that queries the API and performs minor data transformations.
- **`columns.tsx`**: TanStack column array configuration.
- **`constants.tsx`**: Filter and sheet fields configuration.
- **`layout.tsx`**: Simple layout component.
- **`page.tsx`**: Server component to cache `nuqs` search parameters.
- **`query-options.ts`**: Infinite query options used in `client.tsx`.
- **`search-params.ts`**: `nuqs` query parameters configuration.

We explore most of these files in the [Guide (WIP)](https://logs.run/guide) to support you in building your own data-table.

We're continuously refining the setup. While some configurations may appear duplicated, our ultimate goal is to consolidate everything into a single configuration file, making it easier to build an infinite logs data table from front to back.

We're taking you along on this journey.

### What is the `vercel-edge-ping` project?

The [`vercel-edge-ping`](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/vercel-edge-ping) project is a lightweight, community edition of OpenStatus with the following basic features:

- Notification Channels (Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Cron Job (via Vercel or GitHub Actions)
- Storage (Tinybird)

### Do I need to self-host the `data-table-filters` project to access my data?

Self-hosting is not required. If you have `vercel-edge-ping` ingesting data into Tinybird and are using the default pipes, you can open the API endpoint configuration. Click the floating button in the bottom left corner or press <kbd>⌘ + J</kbd>. Enter the base URL, and the `tb_endpoint` cookie will be set automatically. Delete the cookie manually if needed.

Use the [data-table-filters](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/data-table-filters) to build your own logs tables.

### Is an authentication system provided?

No. The project is auth-agnostic, allowing you to implement your preferred authentication solution if needed. Be aware that your data will be publicly accessible via the API endpoint. We might add basic authentication in the future.

### We are looking for more use cases!

Please reach out to [ping@openstatus.dev](mailto:ping@openstatus.dev) if you have specific use cases you'd like to see in action. Your feedback will help us refine the configuration, routes, and component APIs.
