Couple of weeks ago, when we released our CLI. We wanted to use it to run our own Synthetics Tests in a GitHub Action. We wanted to have a simple way to run our tests on every push to our main branch or on schedule.


There's 3 ways to build a github action

- Composite actions
- Javascript actions
- Docker container actions


Our CLI is built in Golang, and publish every version as a binary.  It made sense to go with the Docker container actions.
This way we could use our CLI to run the tests.

We needed to have a way to pass the API key and the configuration file to the action.

Our Docker file is pretty simple. We use the alpine image and install curl to download the CLI. We then extract the CLI and set the entrypoint to the entrypoint.sh file.


```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.21.3

RUN apk --no-cache add curl

WORKDIR /home/openstatus

COPY entrypoint.sh .

RUN  curl -o cli.tar.gz -L  https://github.com/openstatusHQ/cli/releases/latest/download/cli_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz

RUN tar -xf ./cli.tar.gz

ENTRYPOINT ["/home/openstatus/entrypoint.sh"]
```

Our entrypoint.sh file is also pretty simple. We just run the CLI with the API key and the configuration file.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

if [ -z "$INPUT_CONFIG_PATH" ]; then
    /home/openstatus/openstatus run --access-token $INPUT_API_KEY
else
    /home/openstatus/openstatus run --access-token $INPUT_API_KEY --config $INPUT_CONFIG_PATH
fi

if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
    echo "OpenStatus run successfully"
    exit 0
else
    echo "OpenStatus run failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

Our action.yml file

```yaml
name: 'OpenStatus Synthetics CI'
description: 'Run your OpenStatus synthetics checks as part of your GitHub Actions workflow.'
author: 'OpenStatus'
branding:
  icon: 'zap'
  color: gray-dark

inputs:
  api_key:
    description: 'OpenStatus API key'
    required: true
  config_path:
    description: 'Path to the OpenStatus configuration file'
    required: false

runs:
  using: docker
  image: docker://ghcr.io/openstatushq/action:latest
  args:
    - ${{ inputs.api_key }}
    - ${{ inputs.config_path }}
```

That's all you need to build your own Docker custom GitHub Action.



I struggle a bit with the GitHub action because the docker image was being built on the fly.
I had to push the image to the GitHub Container Registry to be able to use it in the action.  You can use any other container registry but GitHub Container Registry is free for public repositories.

The solution was to change the image in the action.yml file to the image in the GitHub Container Registry.

From:

```yaml
image: Dockerfile
```
To:
```yaml
image: docker://ghcr.io/openstatushq/action:latest
```



If you want to start using our action you can find it in the GitHub Marketplace.
