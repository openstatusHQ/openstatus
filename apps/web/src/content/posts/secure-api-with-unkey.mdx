## Introduction

Why do we need to secure our APIs? Well, there are many reasons for that. The
most important one is that we want to protect your data from unauthorized
access.

We will learn how to secure our [Hono.js](https://hono.dev) API server with
[Unkey](https://unkey.dev).

Unkey is a service that allows you to create and manage API keys. It includes
useful features like:

- **Rate limiting**: avoid getting DDoSed
- **Temporary keys**: when working on free trials
- **Key limitation**: limit the number of max. requests

**The best part**: We have no additional database migration or setup to do. Just
use the Unkey API and/or SDK to create, revoke and verify keys.

Hono is similar to express just hipper and runs on the edge.

### How does OpenStatus use Unkey?

Whenever OpenStatus creates an API key, we will send a request to the Unkey API
using their [Typescript SDK](https://docs.unkey.dev/libraries/js/overview) with
the a specific `ownerId` which will be the `workspaceId` in our case. The user
will get an API key back which they can use to access their content via our API
route. Unkey will match the API key to the `ownerId` and we will be able to
validate that the request is the owner of the `workspaceId`.

As an example, here the Next.js `server action` (see
[GitHub](<https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/blob/main/apps/web/src/app/app/(dashboard)/%5BworkspaceSlug%5D/settings/_components/api-keys/actions.ts>))
to allow users to create and revoke their own API keys:

```ts title="actions.ts"
"use server";

import { Unkey } from "@unkey/api";

const unkey = new Unkey({ token: process.env.UNKEY_TOKEN });

export async function create(ownerId: number) {
  const key = await unkey.keys.create({
    apiId: process.env.UNKEY_API_ID,
    ownerId: String(ownerId), // workspaceId
    prefix: "os", // os_1234567890
    // include more options like 'ratelimit', 'expires', 'remaining'
  });
  return key;
}

export async function revoke(keyId: string) {
  const res = await unkey.keys.revoke({ keyId });
  return res;
}
```

To test key creation, you can simply go to the
[Unkey Dashboard](https://unkey.dev/app) and create an API key manually instead
of using the SDK. The SDK is useful once you want your users to create API keys
programmatically.

## Getting started

Checkout [hono.dev](https://hono.dev) if you want to set up a new project or
follow along if you already have a Hono.js project.

We will pinpoint the most important parts of the setup. You can find the full
code source on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/tree/main/apps/server).

### Create the base path

That's as simple as it looks. Create a `new Hono()` instance and define the
routes (`route`) and middlewares (`use`).

For the sake of this example, we only consider the `/api/v1/monitor` route.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { middleware } from "./middleware";
import { monitorApi } from "./monitor";

export type Variables = { workspaceId: string }; // Context

const api = new Hono<{ Variables: Variables }>().basePath("/api/v1");

api.use("/*", middleware);
api.route("/monitor", monitorApi);

export default app;
```

### Create the middleware

The middleware will automatically be applied to all routes that match the path
`/api/v1/*`. We will use the `x-openstatus-key` request header to append the API
key and verify it on our server.

The Hono [Context](https://hono.dev/api/context) will be used to store the
`workspaceId` we are retrieving from Unkey and sharing it across the
application.

Here, we are verifying the API key via the
[`@unkey/api`](https://docs.unkey.dev/libraries/js/overview) package. It returns
either an `error` or the `result.valid` whether or not to grant access to the
user.

```ts title="middleware.ts"
import { verifyKey } from "@unkey/api";
import type { Context, Next } from "hono";

import type { Variables } from "./index";

export async function middleware(
  c: Context<{ Variables: Variables }, "/api/v1/*">,
  next: Next,
) {
  const key = c.req.header("x-openstatus-key");

  if (!key) return c.text("Unauthorized", 401);

  const { error, result } = await verifyKey(key);

  // up to you if you want to pass the actual message to your users
  // or simply return "Internal Server Error"
  if (error) return c.text(error.message, 500);
  if (!result.valid) return c.text("Unauthorized", 401);

  c.set("workspaceId", result.ownerId);

  await next();
}
```

### Create the route

Every route, here `monitorApi`, will have access to the `workspaceId` via the
Context and therefore can query the database for the workspace.

```ts title="monitor.ts"
import type { Variables } from "./index";

export const monitorApi = new Hono<{ Variables: Variables }>();

monitorApi.get("/:id", async (c) => {
  const workspaceId = c.get("workspaceId");
  const { id } = c.req.valid("param");

  // ...fetch data from your database [e.g. via Drizzle ORM]
  const monitor = await db
    .select()
    .from(monitor)
    .where(
      and(
        eq(monitor.id, Number(id)),
        eq(monitor.workspaceId, Number(workspaceId)),
      ),
    )
    .get();

  return c.json(monitor);
});
```

Read more about the Hono path parameter `":id"` in their
[docs](https://hono.dev/api/routing#path-parameter).

### Test it

Once your project is running, you can test your implementation with the
following `curl` command to access your monitor with the id `1`:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/monitor/1' \
--header 'x-openstatus-key: os_1234567890'
```

For OpenStatus, we are running our Hono.js server on [fly.io](https://fly.io)
with [bun](https://bun.sh) via `bun run src/index.ts`.

> We have included the
> [`@hono/zod-openapi`](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/tree/main/packages/zod-openapi)
> plugin to generate an OpenAPI spec out of the box. Read more about the
> supported endpoints in our
> [docs](https://api.openstatus.dev/v1).

## Conclusion

Et voilà. We have secured our API with Unkey and the Hono.js middleware, only
allowing authorized users to access their data.

Unkey increases our velocity and **helps us focus on what's relevant** to the
user, not the infrastructure behind it. We also get **key verification
insights** out of the box and can target specific users based on their usage.

[@chronark\_](https://twitter.com/chronark_) has recently published an
[`@unkey/hono`](https://docs.unkey.dev/libraries/ts/hono) package that uses a
similar implementation under the hood, reducing some boilerplate code for you.
Highly recommend checking it out if you are using Hono.js.
