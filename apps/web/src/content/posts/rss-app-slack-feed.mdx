Using RSS (**Really Simple Syndication**) to stay up to date is definitely underrated. Every site should provide an RSS feed - whether it’s for blog posts, changelogs, or status page updates like incidents, reports, and maintenances. RSS makes it simple to follow the latest news without scraping websites or doom-scrolling through social media.

We’ve supported RSS feeds for a long time, but only recently did I realize how powerful they really are for team communication.

Most of our collaboration happens in Slack, so we've set up an `#rss` channel to subscribe to different feeds. Slack offers a native [RSS app](https://openstatus.slack.com/services/B09H29513HC) that lets you add RSS feeds directly into Slack channels. The app fetches updates every few minutes. It’s not truly real-time (since it polls periodically), so if you need instant notifications it’s not the best fit. But for most use cases, a short delay is perfectly fine - and even most paid Slack RSS integrations rely on the same periodic fetching model.

### How to add RSS feeds to Slack

It’s stupid simple to set up the Slack RSS app.  

Just enter the feed URL and the channel where you want the updates to appear. Done.

Once set up, you can manage and view all your subscriptions in one list.

### Status page RSS feed support  

While we don’t yet provide a direct Slack integration for OpenStatus updates, you can already subscribe to our **status page RSS feeds** (available on every plan), as well as feeds from our **blog** and **changelog**. This way, you can keep all important updates - whether outages, incidents, or maintenance - flowing into your Slack workspace automatically.
