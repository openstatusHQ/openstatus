Using RSS (**Really Simple Syndication**) to stay up to date is definitely underrated. Every site should have a feed - whether it’s for blog posts, changelogs, or status page updates like incidents, reports, and maintenances. RSS makes it simple to follow the latest news without scraping websites or doom-scrolling through social media.

We’ve supported RSS for a long time, but only recently did I realize how powerful it really is.

Most of our team communication happens in Slack, so we've set up an `#rss` channel to subscribe to different feeds. Slack has a native [RSS app](https://openstatus.slack.com/services/B09H29513HC) that fetches updates every few minutes. It’s not real-time, since it polls periodically, so if you need instant notifications, it’s not the best fit. But for most cases, a short delay is perfectly fine. And even paid RSS apps typically work on the same periodic fetching model.

To configure your channel, follow the [official instructions](https://slack.com/help/articles/218688467-Add-RSS-feeds-to-Slack).


While we don’t yet have a Slack integration for status page updates, you can already find RSS feeds across all status pages (on every plan), as well as on our blog and changelog.
