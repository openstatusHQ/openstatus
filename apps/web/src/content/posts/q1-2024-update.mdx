A lot has happened in the first quarter of 2024. We have been working hard to
improve OpenStatus and make it the best open source platform for monitoring the
performance of your services.

## Metrics 📈

Our MRR has increased by 108% compared to the last quarter of 2023 and our new
[pricing](https://www.openstatus.dev/blog/our-new-pricing-explained).

We grew our user base by 38% and now have over 3000 users on the platform.

## Product Updates 🚀

We have shipped a lot of new features in the first quarter of 2024, just to name
a few:

- Reworked our dashboard
- Terraform Providers
- Request Assertion
- Monitor Tags
- Auto Resolved Incidents

But you should check out our [changelog](https://www.openstatus.dev/changelog)
for a complete list of updates.

## Team Update 👥

Thibault went full time on OpenStatus in March 2024 and got father.

## What to expect for the next quarter? 🤔

We are slowly rolling out Real User Monitoring (RUM) to all users. If you want
to be opted in in the beta program, send an email to
[ping@openstatus.dev](mailto:ping@openstatus.dev).

We are also working hard on improving our synthetic monitoring amd making it
more reliable.

We are also planing on making the platform more easily self hosted and remove
most of the external services we rely on. We want to switch from Clerk to either
NextAuth V5 or Lucia.
