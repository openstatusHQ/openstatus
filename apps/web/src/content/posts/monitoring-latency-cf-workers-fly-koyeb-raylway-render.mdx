You want to know which cloud providers offer the lowest latency?

In this post, I compare the latency of
[Cloudflare Workers](#cloudflare-workers), [Fly](#flyio), [Koyeb](#koyeb),
[Railway](#railway) and [Render](#render) using
[OpenStatus](https://www.openstatus.dev).

I deployed the application on the cheapest or free tier offered by each
provider.

For this test, I used a basic [Hono](https://hono.dev) server that returns a
simple text response.

```js
const app = new Hono();
app.use("*", logger());

app.use("*", poweredBy());

app.get("/", (c) => {
  return c.text(
    "Just return the desired http status code, e.g. /404 🤯 \nhttps://www.openstatus.dev",
  );
});
```

You can find the code [here](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/status-code), it’s
open source 😉.

OpenStatus monitored our endpoint every **10 minutes** from **6 locations**
located in Amsterdam, Ashburn, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, Sao Paulo and Sydney.

It's a good way to test our own product and improve it.

Let's analyze the data from the past two weeks.

## Cloudflare workers

Cloudflare Workers is a serverless platform by Cloudflare. It lets you build new
applications using JavaScript/Typescript. You can deploy up to 100 worker
scripts for free, running on more than 275 network locations.

### Timing metrics

| Region | DNS (ms) | Connection (ms) | TLS Handshake (ms) | TTFB (ms) | Transfert (ms) |
| ------ | -------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| AMS    | 17       | 2               | 17                 | 27        | 0              |
| GRU    | 38       | 2               | 13                 | 28        | 0              |
| HKG    | 19       | 2               | 13                 | 29        | 0              |
| IAD    | 24       | 1               | 14                 | 30        | 0              |
| JNB    | 123      | 168             | 182                | 185       | 0              |
| SYD    | 51       | 1               | 11                 | 25        | 0              |

I can notice that Johannesburg's latency is about ten times higher than that of
the other monitors.

### Headers

From the Cloudflare request I can get the location of the workers that handle
the request, with `Cf-ray` in the headers response.

| Checker region | Workers region | number of request |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| HKG            | HKG            | 1831              |
| SYD            | SYD            | 1831              |
| AMS            | AMS            | 1831              |
| IAD            | IAD            | 1831              |
| GRU            | GRU            | 1791              |
| GRU            | GIG            | 40                |
| JNB            | AMS            | 741               |
| JNB            | MUC            | 4                 |
| JNB            | HKG            | 5                 |
| JNB            | SIN            | 6                 |
| JNB            | NRT            | 8                 |
| JNB            | EWR            | 10                |
| JNB            | CDG            | 82                |
| JNB            | FRA            | 276               |
| JNB            | LHR            | 699               |
| JNB            | AMS            | 741               |

I can see all the request from JNB is never routed to a nearby data-center.

Apart from the strange routing error in Johannesburg, Cloudflare workers are
fast worldwide.

I have not experienced any cold start issues.

## Fly.io

Fly.io simplifies deploying and running server-side applications globally.
Developers can deploy their applications near users worldwide for low latency
and high performance. It uses a lightweight Firecracker VM to easily deploy
Docker images.

The DNS is fast, our checker is attempting to connect to a region in the same
data center, but our machine's cold start is slowing us down, leading to the
high TTFB.

Here’s our config for Fly.io:

```toml
app = 'statuscode'
primary_region = 'ams'

[build]
  dockerfile = "./Dockerfile"

[http_service]
  internal_port = 3000
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = true
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
  processes = ['app']

[[vm]]
  cpu_kind = 'shared'
  cpus = 1
  memory_mb = 256
```

The primary region of our server is Amsterdam, and the fly instances is getting
paused after a period of inactivity.

The machine starts slowly, as indicated by the logs showing a start time of
`1.513643778s.`

```

#### OpenStatus Prod metrics

If you update your fly.toml file to include the following, you can get the zero
cold start and achieve a better latency.

```
  min_machines_running = 1
```

This is our data for our production server deploy on Fly.io.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-5">
  <MetricsCard title="uptime" value={100} suffix="%" variant="positive" />
  <MetricsCard title="fails" value={0} suffix="#" variant="negative" />

### Headers

The request headers show that none of our requests are cached. They contain
`cf-cache-status: dynamic`. Cloudflare handles the Koyeb edge layer.
https://www.koyeb.com/blog/building-a-multi-region-service-mesh-with-kuma-envoy-anycast-bgp-and-mtls

Our requests follow this route:

```
Cf workers -> koyeb Global load balancer -> koyeb backend
```

Let’s see where did we hit the cf workers

### Headers

The headers don't provide any information.

Railway is using Google Cloud Platform. It’s the only service that does not
allow us to pick a specific region on the free plan. Our test app will be
located to `us-west1` Portland, Oregon. We can see that the latency is the
lowest in IAD.

By default our app did not scale down to 0. It was always running. We don't have
any cold start.

## Render

Render is a platform that simplifies deploying and scaling web applications and
services. It offers features like automated SSL, automatic scaling, native
support for popular frameworks, and one-click deployments from Git. The platform
focuses on simplicity and developer productivity.

### Headers

The headers don't provide any information.

I have deployed our app in the Frankfurt data-center.

According to the Render docs, the free tier will shut down the service after 15
minutes of inactivity. However, our app is being accessed by a monitor every 10
minutes. We should never scale down to 0.

```
Render spins down a Free web service that goes 15 minutes without receiving inbound traffic. Render spins the service back up whenever it next receives a request to process.
```

I think the failures are due to the cold start of our app. We have a default
timeout of 30s and the render app takes up to 50s to start.We might have hit an
inflection point between cold and warm.

## Conclusion

Here are the results of our test:

| Provider   | Uptime | Fails Ping | Total Pings | AVG latency (ms) | P75 (ms) | P90 (ms) | P95 (ms) | P99 (ms) |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| CF Workers | 100    | 0          | 10,956      | 182              | 138      | 690      | 778      | 991      |
| Fly.io     | 100    | 0          | 10,952      | 1,471            | 1,514    | 1,555    | 1,626    | 2,547    |
| Koyeb      | 100    | 0          | 10,955      | 536              | 738      | 881      | 1,013    | 1,525    |
| Railway    | 99.991 | 1          | 10,955      | 381              | 469      | 653      | 661      | 850      |
| Render     | 99.89  | 12         | 10,946      | 451              | 447      | 591      | 707      | 902      |

If you value low latency, Cloudflare Workers are the best option for fast global
performance without cold start issues. They deploy your app worldwide
efficiently.

For multi-region deployment, check out Koyeb and Fly.io.

For specific region deployment, Railway and Render are good choices.

Choosing a cloud provider involves considering not just latency but also user
experience and pricing.

We use Fly.io in production and are satisfied with it.

#### Vercel

I haven't included Vercel in this test. But we have a blog post comparing Vercel
Serverless vs Edge vs Serverless. You can find it
[here](https://www.openstatus.dev/blog/monitoring-latency-vercel-edge-vs-serverless).
