We’re updating our plans alongside the launch of the new [dashboard](https://openstatus.dev/blog/new-dashboard-we-are-so-back).

A lot of users rely on openstatus for uptime checks and don’t really care about monitoring from _all_ 35 regions at once.

Until now, our **Starter** plan included just **5 monitors**, each checked from all 35 regions in parallel. Going forward, you’ll get **20 monitors**, with the option to choose **up to 6 regions per monitor** - still from the full list of 35.

The **Pro** plan is getting a big upgrade too: we’re going from **15 monitors** to **50(!)** - and you can still monitor from all **35 regions** in parallel if you want.

The free **Hobby** users aren’t affected by this change: you’ll still get **1 monitor**, with the ability to choose from 6 regions.

One thing is moving behind the paywall: **Response Logs**. We’ve added new high-level info like uptime charts and timeline tables that free users can access, but full response details will now be limited to paid plans - we’re hoping this encourages some upgrades. Paid users? No restrictions.

Got questions, relying on response logs as a Hobby user or have been using parallel scheduling on all regions within the Starter plan? Reach out at [ping@openstatus.dev](mailto:ping@openstatus.dev).
