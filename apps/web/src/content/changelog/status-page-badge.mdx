We have added a new feature to embed the status of your service everywhere.

Just copy the following code and paste it into your website or GitHub README:

```html
<img src="https://YOUR-SLUG.openstatus.dev/badge" />
```

And it will look like this:

<a href="https://status.openstatus.dev">
  <img src="https://status.openstatus.dev/badge" />
</a>
