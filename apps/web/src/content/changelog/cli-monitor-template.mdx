In our [previous changelog](/changelog/cli-improvement), we have introduced a new command to create monitors defined in a YAML configuration file.

We have now published a new repository with monitor configuration template:

[https://github.com/openstatusHQ/cli-template](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/cli-template)

Making it easy to manage your openstatus monitors via GitOps.

We are going to add more examples over time to the repository.
