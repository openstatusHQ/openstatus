You can now toggle the new status page version. We provide more flexibility and options to include:

- more tracker options
- community themes
- support button to website / email
- homepage link on logo

Read more within our [documentation](http://localhost:4321/tutorial/how-to-configure-status-page/) and see how your page will look like by going to `[slug].stpg.dev` (e.g. [status.stpg.dev](https://status.stpg.dev)).

We will enable the new status page globally beginning of next year.
