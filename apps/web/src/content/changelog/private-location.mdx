Weâ€™re excited to introduce Private Location, a beta feature that allows you to monitor your services from your own infrastructure!

This means you can set up monitoring agents within your own network, giving you more control and insight into your service performance.

As an example we have deployed a Private Location on [Max's Raspberry Pi](/blog/deploy-private-locations-raspberry-pi) at home, and on [Cloudflare containers](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/how-to-deploy-probes-cloudflare-containers/)
