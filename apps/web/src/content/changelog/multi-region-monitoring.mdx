We have migrated our backend to [fly.io](https://fly.io) and we have enabled
multi regions monitoring by default for every monitor at no extra costs.

Here are the list of regions we are monitoring from:

- `ams` - Amsterdam, Netherlands - 🇳🇱
- `iad` - Ashburn, Virginia, USA - 🇺🇸
- `jnb` - Johannesburg, South Africa - 🇿🇦
- `hkg` - Hong Kong, Honkg Kong - 🇭🇰
- `gru` - Sao Paulo, Brazil - 🇧🇷
- `syd` - Sydney, Australia - 🇦🇺

Happy monitoring!
