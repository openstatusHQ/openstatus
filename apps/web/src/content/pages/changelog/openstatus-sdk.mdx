We have just released our SDK. It allows you to interact with openstatus programmatically, making it easier to automate tasks and integrate with other systems.

Get started with the SDK by installing it via npm:

```bash
npm i @openstatus/sdk-node
```

or via jsr: 

```
deno add jsr:@openstatus/sdk-node
```

You can find the documentation and examples on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/sdk-node). If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to us out.
