We're excited to introduce Status Page Add-ons to give you more control and flexibility:

**Email Authentication**: Restrict access to your status page by email domain. Users will need to verify their email address before viewing the page. Perfect for internal status pages or limited audiences. ($200/mo., applies to all workspace status pages)

**White Label**: Remove the 'powered by openstatus.dev' branding from your status pages for a fully customized experience. ($100/mo., applies to all workspace status pages)

**Additional Status Pages**: Expand beyond your plan's included pages with additional status pages. ($20/mo. per page)
