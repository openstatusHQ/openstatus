You can now protect your status pages with email domain restrictions. Configure allowed email domains to limit access to specific users or organizations. Visitors will need to verify their email address before viewing your status page.

This feature is perfect for internal status pages or when you want to share updates with a specific audience while keeping them private from the public.
