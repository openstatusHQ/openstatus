    answer: "Openstatus pings your endpoints from multiple regions at your configured interval to calculate uptime and response times. It validates responses using assertions (status codes, headers, body content) and alert thresholds. Results appear on your dashboard and automatically reflect on your status page. You can also export metrics to OpenTelemetry."

    answer: "Openstatus monitors from 28 regions worldwide: Europe (Amsterdam, Stockholm, Paris, Frankfurt, London), North America (Dallas, New Jersey, Los Angeles, San Jose, Chicago, Toronto), South America (São Paulo), Asia (Mumbai, Tokyo, Singapore), Africa (Johannesburg), and Oceania (Sydney)."
  - question: "Can I self-host openstatus?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus is fully open source and can be self-hosted using its 8.5MB Docker image. You can also deploy private monitoring locations behind your firewall for internal services. The source code is available on GitHub."
  - question: "How can I contribute to openstatus?"
    answer: "Star the project on GitHub, report bugs, suggest features, contribute code, or become a paid user. You can also spread the word or join the Discord community."

## Status Pages

A status page helps you communicate incidents more effectively. It adds **transparency**, so users aren't left guessing. It enables **proactive communication**, giving updates without users needing to ask. And it shows **reliability**, not just in uptime but in how you handle downtime and keep people informed.

Make it yours with [themes from our Theme Store](https://themes.openstatus.dev), custom domains, and branding. Share publicly or password protect for internal teams. Keep everyone in the loop with status reports, maintenance windows, and subscriptions.

- **Customization** with our Theme Store
- Public or **password protected** pages
- **Custom domains**
- **Status reports** and **maintenance windows**
- **Subscription channels**: email, RSS/Atom, SSH

Read more [about status pages](/status-page).

## Monitoring

Uptime monitoring helps you detect when your website or service goes down. Instead of learning about issues from users, you get **notified immediately** and can respond faster. Monitor your APIs to ensure they return the expected values within a **defined threshold**, helping you **catch** slow responses or failures before they affect users.

Get a real picture with **28 regions** across multiple clouds. Validate your APIs with **assertions** and **thresholds**. Define monitors as **YAML configuration** with our [CLI](https://docs.openstatus.dev/tutorial/get-started-with-openstatus-cli/). Deploy our **8.5MB Docker image** behind firewalls or export to [OpenTelemetry](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/how-to-export-metrics-to-otlp-endpoint/).

- **28 regions** across **multi-cloud providers** (Fly.io, Koyeb, Railway)
- **API Monitoring**: assertions, thresholds, status codes, headers, body validation
- **Monitoring as Code**: YAML configuration, GitHub Actions, CLI
- **Private Locations**: 8.5MB Docker image for internal monitoring
- **Integrations**: OpenTelemetry export, notification channels (email, Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Check all regions in our [global speed checker](/play/checker)

<Details summary="How does uptime monitoring work?">

Openstatus pings your endpoints from multiple regions at your configured interval. Each check validates the response using **assertions** (status codes, headers, body content) and **alert thresholds**. Response time data — including timing phases like DNS, connect, and TTFB — is collected and displayed on your dashboard.

When a check fails, you get notified immediately via your chosen channel (email, Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, and more). Your status page reflects the current state automatically.

Try the [Speed Checker](/play/checker) to see real-time data from all regions.
