## Status Pages

A status page helps you communicate incidents more effectively. It adds **transparency**, so users aren't left guessing. It enables **proactive communication**, giving updates without users needing to ask. And it shows **reliability**, not just in uptime but in how you handle downtime and keep people informed.

Make it yours with [themes from our Theme Store](https://themes.openstatus.dev), custom domains, and branding. Share publicly or password protect for internal teams. Keep everyone in the loop with status reports, maintenance windows, and subscriptions.

- **Customization** with our Theme Store
- Public or **password protected** pages
- **Custom domains**
- **Status reports** and **maintenance windows**
- **Subscription channels**: email, RSS/Atom, SSH

## Monitoring

Uptime monitoring helps you detect when your website or service goes down. Instead of learning about issues from users, you get **notified immediately** and can respond faster. Monitor your APIs to ensure they return the expected values within a **defined threshold**, helping you **catch** slow responses or failures before they affect users.

Get a real picture with **28 regions** across multiple clouds. Validate your APIs with **assertions** and **thresholds**. Define monitors as **YAML configuration** with our [CLI](https://docs.openstatus.dev/tutorial/get-started-with-openstatus-cli/). Deploy our **8.5MB Docker image** behind firewalls or export to [OpenTelemetry](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/how-to-export-metrics-to-otlp-endpoint/).

- **28 regions** across **multi-cloud providers** (Fly.io, Koyeb, Railway)
- **API Monitoring**: assertions, thresholds, status codes, headers, body validation
- **Monitoring as Code**: YAML configuration, GitHub Actions, CLI
- **Private Locations**: 8.5MB Docker image for internal monitoring
- **Integrations**: OpenTelemetry export, notification channels (email, Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Check all regions in our [global speed checker](/landing/play/checker)
