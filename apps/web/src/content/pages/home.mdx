## Status Pages

A status page helps you communicate incidents more effectively. It adds **transparency**, so users aren't left guessing. It enables **proactive communication**, giving updates without users needing to ask. And it shows **reliability**, not just in uptime but in how you handle downtime and keep people informed.

Make it yours with [themes from our Theme Store](https://themes.openstatus.dev), custom domains, and branding. Share publicly or password protect for internal teams. Keep everyone in the loop with status reports, maintenance windows, and subscriptions.

- **Customization** with our Theme Store
- Public or **password protected** pages
- **Custom domains**
- **Status reports** and **maintenance windows**
- **Subscription channels**: email, RSS/Atom, SSH

## Monitoring

Uptime monitoring helps you detect when your website or service goes down. Instead of learning about issues from users, you get **notified immediately** and can respond faster. Monitor your APIs to ensure they return the expected values within a **defined threshold**, helping you **catch** slow responses or failures before they affect users.

Get a real picture with **28 regions** across multiple clouds. Validate your APIs with **assertions** and **thresholds**. Define monitors as **YAML configuration** with our [CLI](https://docs.openstatus.dev/tutorial/get-started-with-openstatus-cli/). Deploy our **8.5MB Docker image** behind firewalls or export to [OpenTelemetry](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/how-to-export-metrics-to-otlp-endpoint/).

- **28 regions** across **multi-cloud providers** (Fly.io, Koyeb, Railway)
- **API Monitoring**: assertions, thresholds, status codes, headers, body validation
- **Monitoring as Code**: YAML configuration, GitHub Actions, CLI
- **Private Locations**: 8.5MB Docker image for internal monitoring
- **Integrations**: OpenTelemetry export, notification channels (email, Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Check all regions in our [global speed checker](/play/checker)

<Details summary="How does it work?">

We ping your endpoints from multiple regions to calculate uptime and display the current status on your status page. We also collect response time data like headers and timing phases and display it on your dashboard.
