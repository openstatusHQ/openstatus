  - question: "What is Uptime SLA?"
    answer: "Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define the expected performance and availability of your services. Understanding uptime percentages and their corresponding downtime allowances is crucial for maintaining customer trust and meeting compliance requirements."
  - question: "What are common SLA tiers?"
    answer: "Common SLA tiers include 99.9% (three nines), 99.99% (four nines), and 99.999% (five nines). For example, 99.9% uptime allows for 8.77 hours of downtime per year, while 99.99% allows only 52.6 minutes annually. All calculations assume continuous 24/7 availability requirements."

## Understanding Uptime SLA

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define the expected performance and availability of your services. Understanding uptime percentages and their corresponding downtime allowances is crucial for maintaining customer trust and meeting compliance requirements.


Common SLA tiers include 99.9% (three nines), 99.99% (four nines), and 99.999% (five nines), each representing different levels of reliability. For example, 99.9% uptime allows for 8.77 hours of downtime per year, while 99.99% allows only 52.6 minutes annually.


This calculator helps you understand the real-world impact of your SLA commitments and plan for capacity, incident response, and stakeholder expectations.
