faq:
  - question: "What Is a Website Speed Checker?"
    answer: "A Website Speed Checker is an online tool that measures how fast your website or API responds when someone visits it. It analyzes various website performance metrics including client-side performance (FCP, LCP, CLS) and server-side performance (DNS lookup, TCP connection, TLS handshake, server response time)."
  - question: "What Is a Global Speed Checker?"
    answer: "A Global Speed Checker measures your website or API's latency and response time from multiple locations around the world. OpenStatus runs checks from 28 global regions across 3 cloud providers, giving you a complete picture of your site's real-world performance."
  - question: "What can I do with openstatus Global Speed Checker?"
    answer: "You can test how fast your API or website responds worldwide, compare latency across different regions, identify network bottlenecks, and monitor uptime and availability in real time from distributed locations across Europe, Asia, North America, and beyond."

### What Is a Website Speed Checker?

A Website Speed Checker is an online tool that measures how fast your website or API responds when someone visits it. It analyzes various website performance metrics to help you understand which elements slow down your page load time.
Speed checkers can focus on two aspects of performance:

- **Client-side performance**, which includes metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) — all indicators of how quickly your site becomes visible and usable to visitors.
- **Server-side performance (or network performance)**, which looks at the technical steps of a request such as DNS lookup, TCP connection, TLS handshake, and server response time.

Understanding both sides helps you identify whether slowdowns are caused by your frontend assets or your backend infrastructure.

### What Is a Global Speed Checker?

A Global Speed Checker measures your website or API's latency and response time from multiple locations around the world. Instead of testing from just one data center, it runs checks from 28 global regions across 3 cloud providers, giving you a complete picture of your site's real-world performance.
