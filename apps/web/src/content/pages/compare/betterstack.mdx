faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good BetterStack alternative?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus offers uptime monitoring from 28 regions (vs. BetterStack's 4), an open-source codebase, parallel check scheduling, and unlimited status page subscribers — all included in the base price. BetterStack charges extra for private status pages ($42/mo.) and subscriber tiers ($42/mo. per 1000). Openstatus is also bootstrapped and self-hostable."
  - question: "How does openstatus pricing compare to BetterStack?"
    answer: "Openstatus starts free (Hobby plan) and paid plans begin at $30/month (Starter) and $100/month (Pro). Private status pages and unlimited subscribers are included. BetterStack's equivalent features require paid add-ons on top of their base price."
  - question: "Does openstatus support as many monitoring regions as BetterStack?"
    answer: "Openstatus monitors from 28 regions worldwide. BetterStack uses approximately 4 regions. Openstatus also uses a parallel scheduling strategy — all selected regions fire simultaneously — whereas BetterStack uses round-robin scheduling."
  - question: "Can I self-host openstatus instead of using the cloud service?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus is open-source (AGPL-3.0 license) and fully self-hostable. BetterStack is a closed-source SaaS product with no self-hosting option."

Openstatus and BetterStack are both uptime monitoring platforms with status pages. Openstatus is open-source, bootstrapped, and built for teams that want global coverage and transparent pricing. BetterStack is a VC-backed, closed-source SaaS with a broader product suite including log management.

The most significant technical difference is scheduling strategy: openstatus checks all selected regions **simultaneously** (parallel), giving you a true global picture of availability at each check interval. BetterStack uses **round-robin** scheduling, cycling through regions one at a time.
