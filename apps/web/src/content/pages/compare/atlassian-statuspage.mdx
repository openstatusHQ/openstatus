category: "company"
faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good Atlassian Statuspage alternative?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus includes built-in uptime monitoring from 28 global regions — something Atlassian Statuspage does not offer at all. Openstatus pricing is flat ($30/mo) and does not scale with subscriber count. Atlassian Statuspage charges per subscriber tier, meaning your bill grows as your audience does. Openstatus is also open-source and self-hostable."
  - question: "Does openstatus include uptime monitoring unlike Atlassian Statuspage?"
    answer: "Yes. Atlassian Statuspage has no built-in monitoring. You must connect a separate tool (Datadog, Pingdom, etc.) to detect incidents. Openstatus monitors your endpoints from 28 regions simultaneously and can update your status page automatically based on check results."
  - question: "How does openstatus pricing compare to Atlassian Statuspage?"
    answer: "Atlassian Statuspage starts at $29/month for one page and 100 subscribers, jumping to $99/month for three pages and $399/month for custom HTML/CSS. Subscriber-count tiers add cost as your audience grows. Openstatus starts at $30/month with flat pricing, unlimited subscribers, and monitoring included."
  - question: "What does the OpsGenie shutdown mean for Statuspage users?"
    answer: "OpsGenie, Atlassian's incident management tool often used alongside Statuspage, is shutting down in April 2027. Teams using the Statuspage + OpsGenie combination will need to find replacements for both. Openstatus covers the monitoring and status page layer in one product."
  - question: "Can I self-host openstatus?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus is open-source (AGPL-3.0) and fully self-hostable. Atlassian Statuspage is a closed-source SaaS with no self-hosting option."

Atlassian Statuspage is the longest-established name in status pages, but it comes with significant trade-offs: **no built-in monitoring**, pricing that scales with your subscriber count, and customization gated behind its most expensive tier. Openstatus covers monitoring and status pages in one product at a fraction of the cost, with flat pricing and an open-source codebase.

The most important structural difference: Atlassian Statuspage requires you to connect a separate monitoring tool (Datadog, Pingdom, New Relic) to detect incidents. Openstatus monitors your endpoints directly from 28 regions and updates your status page automatically — no second tool, no manual webhook wiring.

Additionally, OpsGenie — Atlassian's incident management product often used alongside Statuspage — is shutting down in April 2027.
