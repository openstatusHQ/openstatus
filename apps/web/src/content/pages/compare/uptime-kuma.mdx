category: "company"
faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good Uptime Kuma alternative?"
    answer: "Yes, especially if you want managed cloud hosting or global multi-region monitoring. Both are open-source, but openstatus is available as a SaaS (no server to maintain) and monitors from 28 regions worldwide. Uptime Kuma is self-hosted only and checks from a single server location."
  - question: "What is the main difference between openstatus and Uptime Kuma?"
    answer: "The main difference is hosting model and monitoring coverage. Uptime Kuma is self-hosted only — you run it on your own server and it monitors from that single location. Openstatus is available as a managed SaaS or self-hosted, and checks from 28 regions across multiple cloud providers simultaneously."
  - question: "Is openstatus free like Uptime Kuma?"
    answer: "Openstatus has a free Hobby plan (1 monitor, 6 regions, 1 status page) with no credit card required. Uptime Kuma is fully free and open-source but requires you to provision, host, and maintain your own server."
  - question: "Does openstatus support self-hosting like Uptime Kuma?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus is AGPL-3.0-licensed and can be self-hosted. You also get the option to use the managed cloud service without managing any infrastructure."

Openstatus and Uptime Kuma are both open-source uptime monitoring tools, making this a comparison between two projects with shared values but different architectures. The fundamental difference is the **hosting model**: Uptime Kuma is self-hosted only — you run it on your own server and it monitors from that single location. Openstatus is available both as a **managed SaaS** and for self-hosting, and checks from **28 regions worldwide**.

If you want zero infrastructure responsibility and global multi-region checks, openstatus is the natural choice. If you want a completely free, self-managed tool with full control and no external dependencies, Uptime Kuma is a solid option.
