category: "company"
faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good Instatus alternative?"
    answer: "Yes, especially if you need real uptime monitoring alongside your status page. Instatus is a status-page-first product with basic HTTP monitoring added later. Openstatus was built around monitoring first — checking from 28 global regions simultaneously — with status pages as a native part of the product, not a bolt-on."
  - question: "Does openstatus include a status page like Instatus?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus includes branded status pages with custom domains, maintenance windows, and subscriber notifications on all paid plans. The status page is tightly coupled to your monitors, so incidents and response times reflect real check results."
  - question: "How does openstatus pricing compare to Instatus?"
    answer: "Instatus starts at $20/month for one custom-domain status page. Openstatus starts at $30/month and includes uptime monitoring from 28 regions, unlimited team members, and monitoring-as-code tooling. If you need both monitoring and a status page, openstatus covers both in one plan."
  - question: "Can I self-host openstatus?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus is open-source (AGPL-3.0) and fully self-hostable. Instatus is a closed-source SaaS with no self-hosting option."

Openstatus and Instatus are both alternatives to Atlassian Statuspage, but they cover different ground. Instatus is focused purely on status pages — fast, CDN-delivered, with basic monitoring bolted on as a secondary feature. Openstatus treats **monitoring and status pages as equal parts of the same product**: checks run from 28 regions simultaneously, and your status page reflects those results in real time.

The practical difference: with Instatus, your status page and your monitoring live in separate worlds. With openstatus, an incident detected by a monitor can surface directly on your status page — no manual update, no webhook wiring between tools.
