faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good UptimeRobot alternative?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus monitors from 28 global regions simultaneously (UptimeRobot checks from a single location at a time), is open-source and self-hostable, includes unlimited team members on paid plans, and supports OpenTelemetry export and CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions — none of which UptimeRobot offers."
  - question: "How does openstatus pricing compare to UptimeRobot?"
    answer: "Openstatus starts free and paid plans begin at $30/month with unlimited team members. UptimeRobot charges an additional $19 per seat for team members, which adds up quickly for larger teams."
  - question: "Does openstatus monitor from more regions than UptimeRobot?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus checks from 28 regions worldwide across multiple cloud providers. UptimeRobot does not offer meaningful multi-region monitoring."
  - question: "Can I self-host openstatus?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus is open-source (AGPL-3.0 license) and self-hostable. UptimeRobot is a closed-source SaaS with no self-hosting option."

Openstatus and UptimeRobot are both uptime monitoring tools, but they differ significantly in architecture and capabilities. Openstatus is open-source, monitors from 28 regions **simultaneously**, and includes status pages and developer tooling. UptimeRobot is a long-established closed-source SaaS that checks from a single location at a time with a simpler feature set.

For teams that need global monitoring coverage, CI/CD integration, or a public status page, openstatus is the stronger choice. UptimeRobot remains a simple, well-known option for basic single-location availability checks.
