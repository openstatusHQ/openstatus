faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good Status.io alternative?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus includes built-in uptime monitoring from 28 global regions, which Status.io does not offer. Openstatus is open-source, self-hostable, and starts at $30/month with unlimited team members. Status.io is a closed-source SaaS starting around $79/month with no monitoring capabilities."
  - question: "Does openstatus include uptime monitoring unlike Status.io?"
    answer: "Yes. Status.io is a hosted status page platform with no built-in monitoring. You still need a separate tool to detect incidents. Openstatus monitors your endpoints from 28 regions simultaneously and can reflect real check results on your status page."
  - question: "How does openstatus pricing compare to Status.io?"
    answer: "Status.io starts around $79/month. Openstatus starts at $30/month and includes uptime monitoring, unlimited team members, and developer tooling (CLI, Terraform, GitHub Actions) that Status.io does not offer."
  - question: "Can I self-host openstatus like I cannot with Status.io?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus is open-source (AGPL-3.0) and fully self-hostable. Status.io is a closed-source SaaS with no self-hosting option."

Openstatus and Status.io are both hosted status page platforms, but they differ significantly in scope and price. Status.io is an older, enterprise-oriented status page tool with no built-in monitoring — you need a separate service to detect incidents. Openstatus monitors your endpoints from **28 regions simultaneously**, surfaces results on a native status page, and provides developer tooling (CLI, Terraform, GitHub Actions) that Status.io does not.

For teams that want monitoring and status pages without stitching together two products, openstatus covers both at a lower price point with an open-source codebase.
