faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good incident.io alternative?"
    answer: "It depends on what you need. Incident.io is an incident management platform — on-call scheduling, Slack-based workflows, AI post-mortems. Openstatus is a monitoring and status page platform. If your primary need is detecting outages and communicating them to users, openstatus is the more direct fit. If you already have monitoring and need sophisticated incident coordination across a large on-call team, incident.io is built for that."
  - question: "Does incident.io include uptime monitoring?"
    answer: "No. Incident.io does not monitor your services. It receives alerts from external tools like Datadog, PagerDuty, or Prometheus and routes them through its incident workflow. You still need a separate monitoring tool. Openstatus includes uptime monitoring from 28 regions as part of the same product."
  - question: "Does openstatus have incident management features?"
    answer: "Openstatus covers the detect-and-communicate part of incident response: monitors detect issues and your status page communicates them to users. It does not have on-call scheduling, escalation policies, or Slack-based incident coordination. For teams that need those workflows, incident.io is the stronger choice."
  - question: "How does openstatus pricing compare to incident.io?"
    answer: "Openstatus starts at $30/month with unlimited team members. Incident.io uses per-seat pricing on paid plans and targets mid-to-large engineering teams. For small teams that only need monitoring and a status page, openstatus is significantly cheaper."

Openstatus and incident.io solve adjacent problems. Incident.io is an **incident management** platform — it coordinates the human response to an outage through Slack workflows, on-call scheduling, and post-mortems. Openstatus is a **monitoring and status page** platform — it detects outages automatically and communicates them to end users.

The key distinction: incident.io has no uptime monitoring. It relies on external alerting sources (Datadog, PagerDuty, Prometheus) to trigger its workflows. If you want a single tool that monitors your services and updates your status page without manual intervention, openstatus covers that loop directly. If you have monitoring in place and need sophisticated incident coordination across a large on-call team, incident.io is purpose-built for that.

## When to Choose openstatus

- You need **uptime monitoring + status page** without integrating two separate products
- You want **open-source** software or need to self-host
- You need **monitoring-as-code** or OpenTelemetry export
- You want **predictable pricing** without per-seat charges

## When to Choose incident.io

- Your team already has monitoring (Datadog, PagerDuty) and needs **Slack-based incident coordination**
- You need **on-call scheduling, escalation policies**, and rotation management
- You want **AI-powered post-mortems** and structured incident timelines
- You manage a large on-call rotation across multiple teams or services
