faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good Checkly alternative?"
    answer: "It depends on your use case. Openstatus is focused on uptime monitoring and status pages — it excels at HTTP, TCP, and DNS checks from 28 global regions. Checkly is focused on synthetic monitoring with browser-based checks using Playwright. If you need uptime monitoring with a public status page, openstatus is the stronger choice. If you need end-to-end browser testing as monitoring, Checkly is more suitable."
  - question: "Does openstatus have more monitoring regions than Checkly?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus monitors from 28 regions worldwide. Checkly uses approximately 19 regions. Openstatus also checks all regions simultaneously (parallel scheduling) rather than cycling through them."
  - question: "Does openstatus include a status page?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus includes branded status pages with custom domains, maintenance windows, and subscriber notifications on all plans. Checkly does not offer a built-in public status page product."
  - question: "Is openstatus open-source?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus is AGPL-3.0-licensed and fully self-hostable. Checkly is a closed-source SaaS product."

Openstatus and Checkly take different approaches to monitoring. Openstatus focuses on **uptime monitoring** — checking whether your endpoints are reachable and performant from 28 global regions — and pairs this with **status pages** for incident communication. Checkly focuses on **synthetic monitoring** using Playwright and Puppeteer to run full browser-based end-to-end checks.

If your primary need is knowing when your API or website goes down and communicating that to users, openstatus is the more direct fit. If you need to verify complex user flows (login, checkout, search) are working correctly, Checkly's browser testing approach is more powerful.
