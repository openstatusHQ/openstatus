Build your status page in minutes, not hours. The Openstatus registry gives you production-ready React components specifically designed for status pages. Built on top of shadcn/ui, these components are accessible, customizable, and battle-tested in production.

## What is the Registry?

The Openstatus registry is a shadcn/ui-compatible collection of pre-built components for common status page patterns. Instead of building status indicators, event timelines, and monitoring displays from scratch, you can install and customize these components directly into your project.

All components are:
- **Accessible** - Built with ARIA patterns and keyboard navigation
- **Customizable** - Fully themeable with Tailwind CSS
- **Type-safe** - Written in TypeScript with complete type definitions
- **Production-ready** - Battle-tested in production at Openstatus

## Complete Example

Hover the example below to learn which component is being used.

<Grid cols={1}>

<div>

<StatusPageExample />

</div>

</Grid>

> We are working on matching the component `Props` and the [`@openstatus/sdk-node`](https://jsr.io/@openstatus/sdk-node) return values, allowing you to use our SDK to build your own custom status page.

See the [complete example](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/tree/main/apps/web/src/content/shadcn-registry-example.tsx) for full source code and usage patterns.

## Installation

Install any component with a single command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://openstatus.dev/r/status-complete
```

### Available Components

Components are organized by function:

- **Collections:** `status-complete`, `status-essentials` - Full status page bundles
- **Building Blocks:** `status-banner`, `status-bar`, `status-feed`, `status-events`, `status-component`, `status-icon`, `status-layout`, `status-timestamp` - Individual components
