Build your status page in minutes, not hours. The openstatus registry provides production-ready React components specifically designed for status pages. Built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), these components are accessible, customizable, and battle-tested in production.

## What is the Registry?

The openstatus registry is a collection of shadcn/ui-compatible, pre-built components for common status page patterns. Instead of building status indicators, event timelines, and monitoring displays from scratch, install and customize these components directly into your project.

All components are:
- **Accessible** - Built with ARIA patterns and keyboard navigation
- **Customizable** - Fully themeable with Tailwind CSS
- **Type-safe** - Written in TypeScript with complete type definitions
- **Production-ready** - Battle-tested in production at openstatus

## Example

Hover over the example below to see which component is being used.

<Grid cols={1}>

<div>

<StatusPageExample />

</div>

</Grid>

> We are working on aligning component `Props` with [`@openstatus/sdk-node`](https://jsr.io/@openstatus/sdk-node) return values, enabling you to use our SDK to build your own custom status page.

View the [GitHub source code](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/tree/main/apps/web/src/content/shadcn-registry-example.tsx) for examples and usage patterns.

## Installation

Install any component with a single [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://openstatus.dev/r/status-complete
```

Or install the registry first:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest registry add @openstatus
```
 
 And install the component via:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @openstatus/status-complete
```

### Available Components

Components are organized by functionality:

- **Collections:** `status-complete`, `status-essentials` - Full status page bundles
- **Building Blocks:** `status-banner`, `status-bar`, `status-feed`, `status-events`, `status-component`, `status-icon`, `status-layout`, `status-timestamp` - Individual components
