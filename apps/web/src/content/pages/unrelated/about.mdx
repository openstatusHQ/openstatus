## Our story

We **met on Twitter in 2023**, after couple of months of DM. We started to work on openstatus and were driven by these goals:

- Build something useful **for other developers**
- A real-world project with all the **latest hot technologies**
- Be **open-source**

In 2025 most of it remains true but building with the latest hot technologies was a mistake we are afficionado of the **boring tech**.

## Our values

We are a small team of 2 people, we are a **small company**. We are **not VC funded**. We are not looking for investors. We want to keep our freedom and **build a substainable business** while working on features that provides the best value to our users.

We also want to be **transparent** about our business. We are not going to hide our ups and downs. We are going to share our journey with you.

## Our mission

Let's build the best open-source status page with uptime monitoring. **We are aiming to connect the dot between status page and monitoring with incidents.**
