description: "Openstatus provides a global multi-cloud uptime monitoring solution."
category: "Product"
faq:
  - question: "How many regions should I monitor from?"
    answer: "Start with 3-5 regions covering your main user geographies. More regions provide better global coverage but use more check quota. For critical services, monitor from all major regions (North America, Europe, Asia) to catch regional issues quickly."
  - question: "Why monitor from multiple cloud providers instead of just one?"
    answer: "If your service runs on AWS and your monitoring also runs on AWS, you won't detect AWS-wide outages or network issues affecting AWS connectivity. Using Fly.io, Koyeb, and Railway ensures monitoring independence from your infrastructure provider."
  - question: "What's the difference between frequency settings?"
    answer: "Frequency determines how often we check your service (e.g., every 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes). Higher frequency (30s) catches issues faster but uses more checks. Lower frequency (10m) is sufficient for non-critical services and conserves quota."
  - question: "Can uptime monitoring trigger my status page automatically?"
    answer: "Yes, you can configure monitors to automatically update your status page based on monitoring results. When assertions fail or thresholds are exceeded, the status page can reflect degraded or down status without manual intervention."
  - question: "How do thresholds and assertions work together?"
    answer: "Assertions validate response correctness (status code, headers, body content) while thresholds define performance boundaries (degraded latency, timeout). Both can trigger alerts - assertions catch functional failures, thresholds catch performance degradation."

## Why uptime monitoring is important?

Uptime monitoring is your first line of defense to ensure your service is available for your customers. By monitoring your service from multiple regions around the world, you can be sure that your customers are able to reach your service.

## Why choose openstatus for uptime monitoring?

### Global Monitoring

You can monitor your services from multiple regions around the world. We currently have our probes deployed in **28 regions**.

Check all regions in the [global speed checker](/play/checker).

### Multi Cloud

You should avoid monitoring your services from the same cloud providers you use for those services. That’s why our probes are deployed across three different cloud providers:

- **Fly.io**
- **Koyeb** 
- **Railway** 

### Notification channels

Set different notification channels and **get notified** whenever a not satisfying your assertions or are exceeding the thresholds.

We support:

- Socials: Slack, Discord, Telegram Bot
- Direct: Email, SMS
- Incident Management: OpsGenie, PagerDuty
- Custom: Webhook, Ntfy

### Status Pages

Automatically update your status page based on your uptime monitoring results. Push reports and communicate with your users during incidents. You can choose to **share response details** on your status page. Read more [about status pages](/status-page).

### CLI

You can manage or trigger your monitors via CLI. We provide a simple [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/openstatus-synthetics-ci) to run it in your **CI/CD**.

### Monitoring as code

The best way to **version** your monitor changes is via the openstatus CLI and its **`YAML` config**. Additionally, we provide you a [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/openstatusHQ/openstatus/latest). Read more [about monitoring as code](/monitoring-as-code)
