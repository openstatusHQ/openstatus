    - name: "Deploy the Docker container"
      text: "Pull the private location Docker image (ghcr.io/openstatushq/private-location:latest) and run it with your API key in your infrastructure, VPC, or cloud provider."

    - name: "Verify the connection"
      text: "Check your OpenStatus dashboard to confirm the private location is connected and receiving updates. The probe will automatically sync with your monitors every few minutes."

    - name: "Assign monitors to the private location"
      text: "Update your monitors to use the private location region. The probe will now run checks from inside your network on the defined schedule."

faq:
  - question: "Why is the Docker image only 8.5MB?"
    answer: "We keep it minimal by excluding browser-based checks and bundling only the HTTP monitoring engine. This allows deployment on resource-constrained devices like Raspberry Pis while maintaining full API monitoring capabilities."
  - question: "Can I run multiple private locations in different networks?"
    answer: "Yes, you can deploy as many private location probes as needed across different networks, VPCs, or regions. Each gets its own API key and appears as a separate monitoring region in your dashboard."
  - question: "What platforms support the private location Docker image?"
    answer: "The image supports both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures, running on any Docker-compatible platform including cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure), Cloudflare Containers, Kubernetes, Raspberry Pi, and standard Linux servers."
  - question: "How does the probe communicate with OpenStatus?"
    answer: "The probe makes outbound connections to OpenStatus to fetch monitor configurations and send results. It doesn't require inbound connections or firewall changes, making it safe to run in restricted networks."

Sometimes the services you want to monitor are not accessible from the outside, you want to be able to monitor from your own network.

## Why private locations are important?

Private locations let you monitor internal or restricted services that aren’t reachable from the public internet. They run checks from inside your own network or infrastructure, giving you visibility into systems behind firewalls, or VPCs.

## Why choose openstatus for private locations?

### Deploy everywhere

Simply **deploy our probes** to your favorite **cloud provider**, your own **server** or on your own **virtual private cloud** (VPC).

The docker image is only **8.5MB** small and should easily fit on your infrastructure whether ARM64 or AMD64. We don't provide browser checks and can keep it this small.

### Docker Container

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/openstatushq/private-location:latest
```

Run the docker container. It will start **listening to the changes** of your monitors every few minutes and run the **scheduler** for each frequency defined.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name openstatus-private-location \
  --restart=always \
  -e OPENSTATUS_KEY=$OPENSTATUS_KEY \
  ghcr.io/openstatushq/private-location:latest
```
