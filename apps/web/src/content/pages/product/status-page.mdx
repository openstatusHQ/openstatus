## Why do you need a status page?

A status page is a dedicated webpage that provides real-time information about the operational status of your services. It serves as a communication tool to inform your users about any ongoing incidents, maintenance activities, or service disruptions.

## Why choose openstatus for your status pages?

We provide you with a good **mix of customization and opinionated options**.

### Monitors (or Components)

You can attach specific monitors to a status page. You can either populate the data from the **aggregated uptime** data **or manually** manage them. Read more [about uptime monitoring](/landing/uptime-monitoring).

You can **group monitors** by their services, locations,... and they will be collabsible.

### Customization

Match your brand **appearance** by contributing your own theme to the community. We have build a **[Theme Store](https://themes.openstatus.dev)** that helps you create and use custom themes on your status page. Contribute your own theme. If you a private custom theme let us know via [email](mailto:ping@openstatus.dev?subject=Private%20Theme).

You can **define the values** you want to share with your users. If can decide between duration values/uptime ping values or purely based on manual status report updates.

You can create **custom domains** to keep the domain your users are used to.

### Links

Add a **Get in touch** in touch button and add a specific **website** link or a **`mailto:`** address.

Include a **homepage** link to redirect the user to your page on clicking on the left-hand nav icon.

### Subscriptions

Allow your users **subscribe** to your status page, to automatically receive **updates** whenever you add a status report or maintenance to your status page.

We support following communication channels:

- **Emails**
- **RSS/Atom feeds**

[Contact us](mailto:ping@openstatus.dev) if you are looking for specific a channel.

### Visibility

You can **password protect** your status page. By default, a status page is for the broad public, but if you want to share it internally or with clients, a password helps you from unwanted visitors.

The RSS feed will still work. Append your `?pw=` to the URL **search params** to share private pages.
