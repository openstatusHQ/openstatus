## Why do you need a status page?

A status page is a dedicated webpage that provides real-time information about the operational status of your services. It serves as a communication tool to inform your users about any ongoing incidents, maintenance activities, or service disruptions.

## Why choose openstatus for your status pages?

We provide you with a good **mix of customization and opinionated options**.

### Page Components

You can attach specific monitors to a status page. You can either populate the data from the **aggregated uptime** data **or manually** manage them. Read more [about uptime monitoring](/uptime-monitoring).

Page components provide a **flexible structure** that supports both:
- **Monitors**: Automatically synced with your uptime monitoring data
- **External Services**: Manually managed components for third-party services or systems you don't directly monitor

You can **group page components** by their services, locations, or any logical grouping, and they will be collapsible for better organization.

### Customization

Match your brand **appearance** by contributing your own theme to the community. We have build a **[Theme Store](https://themes.openstatus.dev)** that helps you create and use custom themes on your status page. Contribute your own theme. If you a private custom theme let us know via [email](mailto:ping@openstatus.dev?subject=Private%20Theme).

You can **define the values** you want to share with your users. If can decide between duration values/uptime ping values or purely based on manual status report updates.

You can create **custom domains** to keep the domain your users are used to.

### Links

Add a **Get in touch** in touch button and add a specific **website** link or a **`mailto:`** address.

Include a **homepage** link to redirect the user to your page on clicking on the left-hand nav icon.

### Subscriptions

Allow your users **subscribe** to your status page, to automatically receive **updates** whenever you add a status report or maintenance to your status page.

We support following communication channels:

- **Emails**

### Audience

By default, your status page is public. For internal or client-specific pages, you can protect access using **password protection** or **magic link** authentication to control who can view your updates.
