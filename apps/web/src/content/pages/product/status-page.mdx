faq:
  - question: "When should I use a public vs private status page?"
    answer: "Use public status pages for customer-facing services where transparency builds trust. Use private status pages (password-protected or magic link) for internal tools, client-specific deployments, or when you need to control who receives status updates."
  - question: "What's the difference between monitors and external services in page components?"
    answer: "Monitors are automatically synced with your OpenStatus uptime monitoring data and update in real-time. External services are manually managed components for third-party dependencies or systems you don't directly monitor but want to report status for."
  - question: "Can I use my own domain for the status page?"
    answer: "Yes, you can configure custom domains to host your status page on your own domain (e.g., status.yourcompany.com) instead of the default OpenStatus subdomain. This keeps the experience consistent with your brand."
  - question: "How do status page subscriptions work?"
    answer: "Users can subscribe to receive updates when you post status reports or maintenance notices. We support email notifications, RSS/Atom feeds for feed readers, and JSON feeds for programmatic consumption. Subscribers are automatically notified when you publish updates."
  - question: "Can I customize the appearance of my status page?"
    answer: "Yes, use the Theme Store to apply community themes or create your own. Themes control colors, fonts, and layout. For private custom themes, contact us. You can also define which data to share (uptime percentages, response times, or manual reports only)."

## Why do you need a status page?

A status page is a dedicated webpage that provides real-time information about the operational status of your services. It serves as a communication tool to inform your users about any ongoing incidents, maintenance activities, or service disruptions.

## Why choose openstatus for your status pages?

We provide you with a good **mix of customization and opinionated options**.

### Page Components

You can attach specific monitors to a status page. You can either populate the data from the **aggregated uptime** data **or manually** manage them. Read more [about uptime monitoring](/uptime-monitoring).

Page components provide a **flexible structure** that supports both:
- **Monitors**: Automatically synced with your uptime monitoring data
- **External Services**: Manually managed components for third-party services or systems you don't directly monitor

You can **group page components** by their services, locations, or any logical grouping, and they will be collapsible for better organization.

### Customization

Match your brand **appearance** by contributing your own theme to the community. We have build a **[Theme Store](https://themes.openstatus.dev)** that helps you create and use custom themes on your status page. Contribute your own theme. If you a private custom theme let us know via [email](mailto:ping@openstatus.dev?subject=Private%20Theme).

You can **define the values** you want to share with your users. If can decide between duration values/uptime ping values or purely based on manual status report updates.

You can create **custom domains** to keep the domain your users are used to.

### Links

Add a **Get in touch** in touch button and add a specific **website** link or a **`mailto:`** address.

Include a **homepage** link to redirect the user to your page on clicking on the left-hand nav icon.

### Subscriptions

Allow your users **subscribe** to your status page, to automatically receive **updates** whenever you add a status report or maintenance to your status page.

We support following communication channels:

[Contact us](mailto:ping@openstatus.dev) if you are looking for specific a channel.

### Audience

By default, your status page is public. For internal or client-specific pages, you can protect access using **password protection** or **magic link** authentication to control who can view your updates.
