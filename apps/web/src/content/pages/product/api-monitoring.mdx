category: "Product"
faq:
  - question: "What types of API endpoints can I monitor?"
    answer: "You can monitor any HTTP/HTTPS endpoint including REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, webhooks, and third-party service endpoints. OpenStatus supports all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and custom headers for authentication."
  - question: "How do assertions work in API monitoring?"
    answer: "Assertions let you validate API responses beyond just checking if the endpoint is reachable. You can validate status codes (e.g., expect 200), check for specific text in response bodies, or verify header values. This ensures your API returns correct data, not just any response."
  - question: "What's the difference between internal monitoring tools and OpenStatus?"
    answer: "Internal tools like Grafana or Signoz monitor from inside your infrastructure and see your services as your servers see them. OpenStatus monitors from external locations worldwide, showing you what your customers actually experience including network issues, CDN problems, and geographic latency."
  - question: "Can I export monitoring data to my existing observability stack?"
    answer: "Yes, OpenStatus supports OpenTelemetry (OTLP) export. You can send monitoring metrics to your existing tools like Grafana, Honeycomb, or Datadog, allowing you to combine external monitoring data with your internal metrics and set custom alerts."

## Why monitor your API from an external providers?

Internally you might already have a Grafana, or Signoz deployed. They are working great to monitor your internal metrics, but they are not able to monitor from an external point of view.

With openstatus you can monitor your API from multiple regions around the world, and be sure that your customers are able to reach your API.

## Why choose openstatus for API monitoring?

### Assertions

Validating your response can be important. You can do **status code**, **header** or **body text** assertions. Read more [in the docs](https://docs.openstatus.dev/reference/http-monitor/#assertions).

### Thresholds

You can set a **degraded at** and **timeout** threshold whenever required. We will send you a notification whenever the responses exceed the thresholds.

### Open Telemetry

When needed, you can export to your **OTLP endpoint** the metrics for every request we do. Access the data and set yourself an **alert channel** in Grafana, Honeycomb etc.. Read more [in our guide](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/how-to-export-metrics-to-otlp-endpoint/).

### Private locations

You can **deploy our probes** on your own VPC, [Cloudflare Containers](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/how-to-deploy-probes-cloudflare-containers/) and more. It is **8.5MB small** and fits even on a [Raspberry Pi 3](/blog) with ease. Read more [in the docs](https://docs.openstatus.dev/tutorial/how-to-create-private-location/).

### CLI

You can manage or trigger your monitors via CLI. We provide a simple [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/openstatus-synthetics-ci) to run it in your **CI/CD**.
