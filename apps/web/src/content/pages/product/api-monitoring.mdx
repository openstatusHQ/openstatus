## Why monitor your API from an external providers?

Internally you might already have a Grafana, or Signoz deployed. They are working great to monitor your internal metrics, but they are not able to monitor from an external point of view.

With openstatus you can monitor your API from multiple regions around the world, and be sure that your customers are able to reach your API.

## Why choose openstatus for API monitoring?

### Assertions

Validating your response can be important. You can do **status code**, **header** or **body text** assertions. Read more [in the docs](https://docs.openstatus.dev/reference/http-monitor/#assertions).

### Thresholds

You can set a **degraded at** and **timeout** threshold whenever required. We will send you a notification whenever the responses exceed the thresholds.

### Open Telemetry

When needed, you can export to your **OTLP endpoint** the metrics for every request we do. Access the data and set yourself an **alert channel** in Grafana, Honeycomb etc.. Read more [in our guide](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/how-to-export-metrics-to-otlp-endpoint/).

### Private locations

You can **deploy our probes** on your own VPC, [Cloudflare Containers](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/how-to-deploy-probes-cloudflare-containers/) and more. It is **8.5MB small** and fits even on a [Raspberry Pi 3](/blog) with ease. Read more [in the docs](https://docs.openstatus.dev/tutorial/how-to-create-private-location/).

### CLI

You can manage or trigger your monitors via CLI. We provide a simple [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/openstatus-synthetics-ci) to run it in your **CI/CD**.
