Use this template when specific features are degraded or unavailable, but the core service remains operational. Helps users understand what's working and what isn't.

## When to Use This Template

- Specific feature experiencing errors
- Elevated latency for particular operations
- Partial functionality unavailable
- Non-critical systems impaired

## Template Messages

### Investigating

We are experiencing issues with [Feature Name]. The core service remains available, but this specific feature may not work as expected.

Our team is actively investigating and working to restore full functionality.

### Identified

We have identified the cause of the [Feature Name] degradation. Our team is implementing a fix.

### Monitoring

[Feature Name] has been restored. We are monitoring to ensure stable operation.

### Resolved

[Feature Name] is now fully operational. All features are working normally.

## Real-World Examples

### Notion: "Operations such as duplicate a page or move a block"

**Context**: Specific operations failing while rest of service worked
**Duration**: ~4 hours
**Impact**: Users could read/edit but not duplicate or move content

**What worked**:
- Specific about which operations were affected
- Clear that core functionality (reading, editing) still worked
- Precise timestamps in user's timezone (PST)

**Sample progression**:
```
12:10pm PST - Investigating
"We are experiencing an incident that affects operations such as
duplicate a page or move a block."

2:30pm PST - Identified
"We've identified the issue and are implementing a fix. Most
operations continue to work normally."

4:09pm PST - Resolved
"All operations have been restored. The issue has been fully resolved."
```

### Notion: "Exporting pages remains in a loading state"

**Context**: Export feature stuck, but rest of service worked
**Approach**: Clear about single feature impact

**Why it worked**:
- Users knew exactly what was broken
- Clear that it wasn't a full outage
- No operational downtime reported for core features

### GitHub: "Some models missing in Copilot"

**Context**: Specific AI models unavailable
**Duration**: ~2.5 hours
**Impact**: Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 inaccessible; other models worked

**Communication breakdown**:
```
Investigating:
"Some users unable to access premium AI models in GitHub Copilot"

Identified:
"Misconfiguration marking Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 as inaccessible.
Other models functioning normally. Deploying configuration fix."

Resolved:
"All models now accessible. Configuration has been corrected and
validated across all regions."
```

**Why it worked**:
- Specific model names (users could check if they were affected)
- Clear that other models still worked
- Technical but not overly complex

## Clear Scope Communication

### ✅ Good Examples

**Specific and clear**:
```
The file upload feature is currently unavailable. All other features,
including viewing, editing, and sharing, are working normally.
```

**With workaround**:
```
Export functionality is temporarily degraded. Exports may take 2-3x
longer than usual. Viewing and editing are unaffected.

Workaround: For faster exports, try exporting smaller sections
individually.
```

**With context**:
```
Search is experiencing elevated latency (5-10 seconds vs normal <1s).
We're working on a fix. All other features operating normally.
```

### ❌ Vague Examples

```
"Some features might not work"
"Experiencing issues"
"Partial service degradation"
"Some users affected"
```

## Feature Impact Matrix

Help users quickly understand what works and what doesn't:

### Example 1: Export Feature Down
```
Current Status:

Working:
✓ View documents
✓ Edit documents
✓ Share with team
✓ Comments and collaboration
✓ Search

Not Working:
✗ PDF export
✗ CSV download
✗ Bulk export

We're working to restore export functionality.
```

### Example 2: Upload Feature Degraded
```
Current Status:

Working Normally:
✓ View files
✓ Download files
✓ Share links
✓ Delete files

Degraded:
⚠️ File uploads (50% success rate, retrying usually works)
⚠️ Drag-and-drop (use upload button instead)

We're investigating the upload issues.
```

## Communication by Feature Type

### Core Features Degraded

When important features fail, be very clear about impact:

```
🔴 Payment Processing Degraded

Impact: High - payments may fail or experience delays

Status: We're experiencing elevated error rates (10%) on payment
processing. Most transactions are succeeding, but some may fail.

Action: If your payment fails, please wait 5 minutes and retry.
We're working on a fix.

Other features: Account management, viewing history, and settings
all working normally.
```

### Secondary Features Down

When nice-to-have features fail:

```
🟡 Analytics Dashboard Unavailable

Impact: Low - core product features unaffected

Status: The analytics dashboard is temporarily unavailable due to
a database issue. All product features continue working normally.

Your data is safe and being collected. Analytics will be updated
once the dashboard is restored.
```

### Batch/Background Features

When background processes are affected:

```
⚠️ Report Generation Delayed

Impact: Reports scheduled in the last hour will be delayed.

Status: The background job processor is experiencing issues. Reports
will still generate, but may take 2-4 hours instead of the usual
15 minutes.

If you need a report urgently, please contact support@company.com
and we can prioritize it.
```

## User Action Guidance

### No Action Needed
```
The issue is on our end. No action is required from you. We'll
update this status when resolved.
```

### Retry Recommended
```
If you encounter an error, please wait 30 seconds and try again.
Most operations succeed on the second attempt.
```

### Workaround Available
```
While we work on a fix, you can use this workaround:
1. Go to Settings > Export
2. Select "Legacy Export Mode"
3. Your export should complete successfully

We'll notify you when the standard export is restored.
```

### Avoid Feature Temporarily
```
We recommend avoiding [feature] until this is resolved to prevent
data sync issues. We'll send an all-clear when it's safe to use again.
```

## Timing and SLA Context

### When degradation exceeds SLA:

```
Update: This degradation has exceeded our 99.9% uptime SLA for the
month. Affected customers will receive automatic service credits as
per our SLA terms. No action needed from you.
```

### When approaching SLA:

```
We're aware this degradation is approaching our SLA threshold. We're
treating this as high priority and have additional engineers engaged.
```

## Progressive Updates

### Initial (Minute 0)
```
We're investigating reports of [feature] not working correctly.
Some users may experience errors. Core functionality unaffected.
```

### Update 1 (Minute 15)
```
We've confirmed [feature] is experiencing issues. Approximately
20% of requests are failing. We're investigating the cause.
```

### Update 2 (Minute 30)
```
Root cause identified: database connection timeout on [specific service].
Implementing a fix now. Estimated resolution: 15 minutes.
```

### Update 3 (Minute 45)
```
Fix deployed. [Feature] error rate has dropped from 20% to 2%.
Monitoring for full recovery.
```

### Final (Minute 60)
```
[Feature] is fully restored. Error rates back to normal (< 0.1%).
No user action required. Thank you for your patience.
```

## Partial vs. Complete Degradation

### Partial (50% working)
```
[Feature] is partially degraded. About half of requests are succeeding.
If you receive an error, try again in a few seconds - you'll likely
succeed on the second or third attempt.
```

### Severe (90% failing)
```
[Feature] is severely degraded with most requests failing. We recommend
waiting until this is resolved rather than retrying repeatedly.

ETA for fix: 30 minutes
```

### Complete (100% down)
```
[Feature] is currently unavailable. We've identified the issue and
are working on a fix.

Estimated restoration: 15 minutes
We'll notify you as soon as it's back.
```

## Post-Resolution Analysis

After resolving, explain what happened:

```
[Feature] has been fully restored.

What happened: A configuration change caused connection timeouts
to the [service] backend.

Resolution: We rolled back the configuration change and implemented
additional connection monitoring.

Prevention: We're adding pre-deployment validation for configuration
changes to catch issues like this before they reach production.

Thank you for your patience while we resolved this issue.
