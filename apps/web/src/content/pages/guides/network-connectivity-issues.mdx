Use this template when experiencing network-related issues affecting user connectivity, including CDN problems, regional outages, or ISP issues.

## When to Use This Template

- Regional network outages
- CDN degradation or failures
- DNS resolution problems
- ISP-specific connectivity issues
- DDoS mitigation impacts

## Template Messages

### Investigating

We are aware of connectivity issues affecting some users. The issue appears to be network-related and we are investigating the root cause.

Our team is working to restore connectivity as quickly as possible.

### Identified

We have identified the cause of the connectivity issues. Our team is working with our network provider to implement a fix.

### Monitoring

Network connectivity has been restored. We are monitoring the situation to ensure stability across all regions.

### Resolved

The connectivity issues have been fully resolved. All users should now have normal access to our services.

## Real-World Examples

### Fly.io: "Network instability in IAD region"

**Context**: Regional infrastructure problem
**Location**: IAD (Ashburn, Virginia)
**Approach**: Geographic specificity

**What they did well**:
- Named the specific region affected
- Used technical but clear naming ("network instability")
- Focused on infrastructure layer vs vague "connectivity problems"

**Why it worked**: Users in that region immediately knew they were affected, while users elsewhere knew they weren't experiencing issues.

### GitHub: Infrastructure with Specific Impact Areas

**Context**: Multi-service infrastructure issues
**Approach**: Service-by-service breakdown

**Sample structure**:
```
We're experiencing connectivity issues affecting:
- Issues and Pull Requests: 10% error rate
- GitHub Actions: 5% job failures
- API: Elevated latency

Other services operating normally.
```

**Why it worked**: Users could quickly assess if their workflow was affected.

## Geographic Specificity Best Practices

### Be Specific About Location

✅ Good:
- "Users in Europe experiencing connectivity issues"
- "Network problems in AWS us-east-1 region"
- "CDN degradation affecting Asia-Pacific"

❌ Vague:
- "Some users having problems"
- "Network issues"
- "Connectivity degraded"

### Example: Regional Communication

**For global outage**:
```
We're experiencing network connectivity issues affecting users globally.
Our network provider is investigating. We'll provide updates every 30 minutes.
```

**For regional outage**:
```
We're aware of connectivity issues affecting users in the EU region.
This appears to be related to our CDN provider. US and Asia-Pacific
regions are operating normally.
```

**For ISP-specific**:
```
We're receiving reports of connectivity issues from users on [ISP Name].
We're working with the ISP to resolve. Users on other networks should
not be affected.
```

## CDN-Specific Communication

When CDN issues affect your service:

### During Investigation
```
We're experiencing degraded performance due to issues with our CDN provider.
Users may see slower load times or intermittent connectivity. We're working
with [CDN Provider] to resolve this quickly.
```

### When Switching to Backup
```
We've temporarily switched traffic to our backup CDN to restore performance.
You may experience brief disruptions during this transition.
```

### After Resolution
```
CDN performance has been fully restored. All traffic has been returned to
our primary provider, and we're monitoring closely for any recurring issues.
```

## DNS Issues Communication

### Initial Report
```
We're aware of DNS resolution failures affecting access to [service].
Some users may receive "site cannot be reached" errors. We're working
with our DNS provider to resolve this immediately.

Workaround: If you have our service's IP address cached, you can
still access via direct IP.
```

### Resolution
```
DNS resolution has been restored. Changes may take 5-15 minutes to
propagate globally due to DNS caching. If you still can't access
the service, try clearing your DNS cache or waiting a few minutes.
```

## Providing Workarounds

Always include workarounds when possible:

### Example 1: CDN Issues
```
While we work on the connectivity issue, you can access the service
directly via: https://direct.yourservice.com (bypasses CDN)
```

### Example 2: Regional Issues
```
Users in affected regions can temporarily use our US endpoint:
https://us.yourservice.com
```

### Example 3: API Connectivity
```
If experiencing timeouts, try reducing request rate or adding retry
logic with exponential backoff. We'll send an all-clear when issues
are fully resolved.
```

## DDoS Mitigation Communication

### During Active Mitigation
```
We're currently mitigating a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.
Some users may experience:
- Slower response times
- CAPTCHA challenges
- Temporary access blocks

These are protective measures. Your data and account remain secure.
```

### Post-Mitigation
```
The DDoS attack has been successfully mitigated. All protective measures
remain in place. Service performance has returned to normal.
```

## Timing Expectations

Set clear expectations about updates:

```
We're investigating network connectivity issues in the APAC region.
We'll provide updates every 15 minutes until resolved.

Next update: 10:15 UTC
```

Then honor that commitment:

```
[10:15 UTC Update] Still investigating. Network provider has identified
the issue and is implementing a fix. We expect resolution within 30 minutes.

Next update: 10:30 UTC or sooner if resolved.
```

## Multi-Region Status Example

For services with multiple regions:

```
Current Status:
- 🔴 EU-West: Major connectivity issues
- 🟡 US-East: Minor latency increases
- 🟢 US-West: Operating normally
- 🟢 Asia-Pacific: Operating normally

We're prioritizing restoration of EU-West and monitoring other regions closely.
```

## Third-Party Provider Communication

When the issue is with a third-party:

✅ **Be transparent but professional**:
```
We're experiencing connectivity issues due to problems with our CDN
provider, Cloudflare. They are working on a fix. We're monitoring
their status page and will update you as we learn more.
```

❌ **Don't blame or criticize**:
```
Cloudflare is down again! Not our fault! 🤷
```

## Follow-Up After Resolution

### Short-Term (Same Day)
```
Connectivity has been fully restored across all regions. We're continuing
to monitor for any recurring issues.
```

### Medium-Term (Next Day)
```
Yesterday's connectivity issues were caused by [root cause]. We're working
with our network provider to implement additional safeguards to prevent
recurrence.
```
