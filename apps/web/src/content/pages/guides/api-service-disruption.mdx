Use this template when your API or third-party service provider is experiencing issues. Based on real-world examples from companies like Vercel, Stripe, and GitHub.

## When to Use This Template

- Third-party API failures
- Elevated API error rates
- Service provider outages
- Integration connectivity issues

## Template Messages

### Investigating

We are currently experiencing issues with our third-party API provider. Our team is actively investigating and working with the provider to restore normal service.

We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide updates as we learn more.

### Identified

We have confirmed the issue is with our third-party provider's infrastructure. They are working on a fix and we are monitoring their progress.

### Monitoring

A fix has been deployed. We are monitoring service health and will confirm full restoration shortly.

### Resolved

The service has been fully restored. All API operations are back to normal. We apologize for the disruption.

## Real-World Examples

### Vercel: "Elevated error rates across new deployments and Vercel API"

**Context**: Build failures and deployment issues affecting multiple systems
**Duration**: ~32 minutes
**Impact**: New deployments and API calls

This incident title demonstrates clear scope communication - users immediately understood both the severity ("elevated error rates") and which systems were affected.

### GitHub: "Configuration error during a model update"

**Context**: Copilot service degradation
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Impact**: 18% average error rate, peaking at 100%

GitHub's approach included specific metrics and root cause transparency, helping technical users understand the scope and nature of the issue.

### Stripe: Payment Method Maintenance

**Context**: Scheduled maintenance for payment providers
**Approach**: Proactive communication with disclaimers about third-party information

Stripe consistently provides context about the source of information and sets clear expectations about accuracy.

## Tips for Using This Template

1. **Be specific about the provider** if you can share that information
2. **Include timeframes** when you have them (e.g., "Expected resolution: 30 minutes")
3. **Add metrics** if you're comfortable sharing them (e.g., "affecting 5% of requests")
4. **Acknowledge impact** - users appreciate transparency about what's affected
5. **Follow up after resolution** with any lessons learned or preventative measures

## Customization Ideas

- Add your specific API names (e.g., "Payment API" instead of generic "API")
- Include workaround instructions if available
- Link to status dashboard or real-time monitoring
- Add contact information for urgent support needs
