title: "API Service Disruption Template"
description: "Professional template for communicating API outages and third-party service failures to your users."
author: "openstatus"
publishedAt: "2026-01-19"
category: "template"
faq:
  - question: "How often should I update users during an API disruption?"
    answer: "Provide updates every 30-60 minutes during active incidents, even if there's no significant change. Users appreciate knowing you're still working on the issue. Once resolved, a final summary is essential."
  - question: "Should I name the third-party provider causing the issue?"
    answer: "Yes, if you can. Being specific helps users understand the scope and that you're transparent about dependencies. Companies like Vercel, Stripe, and GitHub regularly name their providers during incidents. Just remain professional and factual."
  - question: "What metrics should I include in API disruption updates?"
    answer: "Include error rates (e.g., '5% of requests failing'), affected endpoints, and timeframes when you have them. Avoid oversharing internal metrics that might confuse users. Focus on impact-oriented data that helps them assess how they're affected."
  - question: "When should I use this template instead of other incident templates?"
    answer: "Use this template specifically for API-related issues, third-party provider failures, or integration connectivity problems. Use Database Performance for database-specific issues, Deployment Rollback for deployment failures, or Network Connectivity for regional/CDN issues."

Use this template when your API or third-party service provider is experiencing issues. Based on real-world examples from companies like Vercel, Stripe, and GitHub.

## When to Use This Template

- Third-party API failures
- Elevated API error rates
- Service provider outages
- Integration connectivity issues

## Template Messages

### Investigating

We are currently experiencing issues with our third-party API provider. Our team is actively investigating and working with the provider to restore normal service.

We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide updates as we learn more.

### Identified

We have confirmed the issue is with our third-party provider's infrastructure. They are working on a fix and we are monitoring their progress.

### Monitoring

A fix has been deployed. We are monitoring service health and will confirm full restoration shortly.

### Resolved

The service has been fully restored. All API operations are back to normal. We apologize for the disruption.

## Real-World Examples

### Vercel: "Elevated error rates across new deployments and Vercel API"

**Context**: Build failures and deployment issues affecting multiple systems
**Duration**: ~32 minutes
**Impact**: New deployments and API calls

This incident title demonstrates clear scope communication - users immediately understood both the severity ("elevated error rates") and which systems were affected.

### GitHub: "Configuration error during a model update"

**Context**: Copilot service degradation
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Impact**: 18% average error rate, peaking at 100%

GitHub's approach included specific metrics and root cause transparency, helping technical users understand the scope and nature of the issue.

### Stripe: Payment Method Maintenance

**Context**: Scheduled maintenance for payment providers
**Approach**: Proactive communication with disclaimers about third-party information

Stripe consistently provides context about the source of information and sets clear expectations about accuracy.

## Tips for Using This Template

1. **Be specific about the provider** if you can share that information
2. **Include timeframes** when you have them (e.g., "Expected resolution: 30 minutes")
3. **Add metrics** if you're comfortable sharing them (e.g., "affecting 5% of requests")
4. **Acknowledge impact** - users appreciate transparency about what's affected
5. **Follow up after resolution** with any lessons learned or preventative measures

## Customization Ideas

- Add your specific API names (e.g., "Payment API" instead of generic "API")
- Include workaround instructions if available
- Link to status dashboard or real-time monitoring
- Add contact information for urgent support needs
