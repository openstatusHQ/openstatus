faq:
  - question: "Do I really need a status page if my service rarely goes down?"
    answer: "Yes. Users expect transparency from every SaaS product now. Not having a status page signals you're either hiding problems or haven't thought about reliability. Both destroy trust with technical buyers and enterprise customers."
  - question: "Won't a status page make us look unreliable?"
    answer: "The opposite. Hiding incidents makes you look unreliable. A status page with honest incident history proves you take reliability seriously and communicate transparently. Companies like Stripe and Vercel publish detailed postmortems - it builds trust, not doubt."
  - question: "We're a small startup - shouldn't we wait until we're bigger?"
    answer: "No. Start simple now. A basic status page takes 5 minutes to set up and establishes good habits early. Waiting until after your first major incident means angry customers watching you scramble to set up infrastructure you should have had from day one."
  - question: "How does a status page reduce support load?"
    answer: "During incidents, hundreds of customers ask 'is it down?' Instead of flooding support with tickets, they check your status page and get an immediate answer. Your support team can focus on helping users affected by the incident rather than repeating the same status update."
  - question: "What's the ROI of a status page?"
    answer: "Direct ROI: reduced support tickets during incidents, lower customer churn, faster enterprise sales cycles. Indirect ROI: SEO traffic from '[your-product] status' searches, trust building that leads to word-of-mouth, and competitive differentiation against companies that hide their incidents."

**TL;DR** - Status pages aren't a nice-to-have for SaaS products anymore. They're table stakes. Proactive communication reduces support load, retains customers during incidents, and builds trust that no marketing campaign can replicate. Not having one actively hurts your business.

## You Will Have an Outage

Every SaaS has incidents. Your database will fail. Your API will return 500s. Your CDN provider will have an outage. AWS will go down and take half the internet with it.

The question isn't *if* you'll have downtime - it's *how you'll communicate when it happens*.

When your service breaks at 2 PM on a Tuesday and users can't complete their workflows, they have two options: check your status page or flood your support channels asking "is it down?"

If you don't have a status page, they choose Twitter. Reddit. Your support email. Your founder's DMs. Now you're managing an incident *and* a communication crisis simultaneously.

A status page turns chaos into clarity. One source of truth. Real-time updates. No speculation.

## It's Expected Now - Especially for B2B

Enterprise customers don't evaluate whether you *should* have a status page. They assume you do. Security questionnaires explicitly ask for it. Procurement teams check during vendor evaluation. The absence of a status page is a red flag that you don't take reliability seriously.

Try closing a $50k annual contract without being able to point to:
- Historical uptime data
- Transparent incident communication
- Documented SLAs (link to: sla-vs-slo-vs-sli.md)

You'll lose deals to competitors who can.

For B2C products, the stakes are different but just as real. When your app feels slow, users Google "[your product] status" before they even refresh the page. If third-party status checkers dominate those search results instead of *your* official page, you've lost control of the narrative.

## Reduces Support Load (Immediately)

During an incident, your support team gets bombarded with the same question hundreds of times: "Is it down?"

Without a status page, they spend hours sending the same canned response. With one, they send a link. The status page answers:
- Yes, we're aware
- Here's what's affected
- Here's what we're doing about it
- Here's when we expect resolution

That's hundreds of saved support tickets. Faster resolution for users who *actually* need help beyond "yes, it's down." And a support team that stays focused instead of drowning in duplicates.

## Trust and Transparency Beat Silence

Silence during outages destroys credibility. Users assume the worst: you don't know what's wrong, you're scrambling, you're hiding something.

Being upfront - even when the news is bad - shows professionalism. [Public postmortems](/guides/public-postmortem-underrated-marketing) prove you understand your systems and take incidents seriously. Companies like GitLab and Vercel have turned potential PR disasters into proof of engineering maturity by being radically transparent.

**Your status page is part of that transparency.** It signals: we measure our uptime, we communicate during incidents, and we don't hide from problems.

Customers are more forgiving when informed. A 30-minute outage with real-time updates feels manageable. A 30-minute outage with zero communication feels like negligence.

## SEO and Discovery (Free Marketing)

Your status page ranks for high-intent searches:
- "[your product] status"
- "is [your product] down"
- "[your product] uptime"

These searches spike during incidents - exactly when you *need* to control the message. If you don't have a status page, third-party status checkers and Reddit threads dominate those results. Now users are reading speculation instead of facts.

A well-maintained status page:
- Captures that search traffic
- Establishes you as authoritative about your own service
- Becomes a backlink magnet (other sites reference your status updates)
- Shows up in competitor research ("why does [competitor] have a status page and we don't?")

That's organic visibility you don't pay for. It compounds over time.

## Internal Accountability

Building a status page forces you to think about reliability:
- What uptime are we actually achieving?
- What [SLAs can we realistically offer](/guides/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli)?
- How quickly do we detect and respond to incidents?
- What does our incident management process look like?

These aren't optional questions once you have paying customers. A status page makes them urgent.

It also creates historical data for post-mortems. When did the incident start? How long did it take to detect? How long to resolve? You can't improve what you don't measure.

## Common Objections (and Why They're Wrong)

### "We don't have outages"

You will. And when you do, scrambling to set up a status page *during* an incident looks worse than not having one at all. Build it now, while everything is calm.

### "It's too expensive"

It's not. Open-source options exist. Free tiers exist. The cost of *not* having one - lost deals, support overhead, customer churn - is higher.

### "It makes us look unreliable"

Hiding problems makes you look unreliable. A status page with honest incident history proves you're transparent and mature about operations. [Boring, fast, and honest](/guides/boring-is-better-for-status-pages) beats flashy and evasive.

### "We're too small"

You're the perfect size to build good habits. Startups who wait until they're "big enough" end up implementing it during a crisis instead of proactively. Start simple. Grow into it.

### "We'll build one when we need it"

You need it *before* the incident. Customers checking your status page during downtime and finding nothing is worse than finding transparent updates.

## What Makes a Good Status Page

Not all status pages are created equal. Here's what actually matters:

**[Public by default](/guides/public-vs-private-status-pages)** - unless you have a specific reason to restrict access (internal teams, enterprise customers), make it public. Transparency builds trust.

**[Boring and fast](/guides/boring-is-better-for-status-pages)** - no animations, no JavaScript dependencies that fail during incidents. Static HTML that loads instantly when everything else is broken.

**Real data, not theater** - show actual uptime. Don't round 99.85% to 99.9%. [Uptime percentages alone are misleading](/guides/why-uptime-percentage-is-misleading), but they're better than nothing.

**Incident history** - don't hide past outages. Show resolved incidents with timelines. It proves you've handled incidents before and will again.

**Readable updates** - during active incidents, write for stressed users who need clarity. No jargon. No corporate speak. Just: what broke, what we're doing, when we expect resolution.

## Getting Started

You don't need perfection. You need *something*.

Start with:
1. A simple page showing current status (operational, degraded, down)
2. Automated monitoring that updates status in real-time
3. A process for posting incident updates
4. Historical uptime data

That's it. You can add metrics, regional breakdowns, and advanced features later. The important part is having *a page* before you need it.

Open-source options exist (openstatus, Uptime Kuma, Cachet). Hosted platforms exist. Pick one and ship it. Waiting for the "right" solution means you won't have one when it matters.

## The Bottom Line

Every SaaS will have incidents. The difference between companies that retain trust and companies that lose it comes down to communication.

A status page:
- Reduces support load during outages
- Builds trust through transparency
- Meets enterprise customer expectations
- Captures SEO traffic
- Forces internal accountability

Not having one is actively hurting your business. You're losing deals, frustrating customers, and burning support resources on preventable ticket floods.

Start today. Not after your first major incident.
