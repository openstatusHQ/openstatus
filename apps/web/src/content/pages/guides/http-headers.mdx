title: "HTTP Headers Every Developer Should Know"
description: "A practical reference for common HTTP request and response headers, security headers, and the cloud provider-specific headers you'll encounter when monitoring APIs."

faq:
  - question: "What are HTTP headers?"
    answer: "HTTP headers are metadata key-value pairs sent alongside HTTP requests and responses. They define content types, authentication, caching behavior, security policies, and more."
  - question: "What is Cache-Control?"
    answer: "Cache-Control is an HTTP response header that tells browsers and CDNs how long to cache a response. Directives like max-age, no-cache, and no-store control caching behavior."
  - question: "What's the difference between X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP?"
    answer: "X-Forwarded-For contains a chain of IPs added by each proxy. X-Real-IP is set by the first proxy and reflects just the original client IP."
  - question: "What is a CF-Ray header?"
    answer: "CF-Ray is a Cloudflare-specific header that uniquely identifies a request. It's the first thing Cloudflare support will ask for when debugging an issue."

HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent alongside requests and responses. They carry metadata about authentication, content format, caching, and security—and are the first place to look when something behaves unexpectedly.

```
Header-Name: header-value
```

Header names are case-insensitive; values are not.

## Request Headers

**`Accept`**
Which content types the client can handle. The `q` parameter sets preference weight.
```
Accept: application/json, text/html;q=0.9
```

**`Accept-Encoding`**
Compression algorithms the client supports. Servers compress responses accordingly.
```
Accept-Encoding: gzip, br, deflate
```

**`Accept-Language`**
The client's preferred language for response content.
```
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
```

**`Authorization`**
Credentials for accessing protected resources. Common schemes: `Bearer`, `Basic`, `ApiKey`.
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**`Content-Type`**
The format of the request body. Required for `POST`/`PUT` requests with a body.
```
Content-Type: application/json
```

**`Cookie`**
Previously stored cookies sent back to the server for session or user identification.
```
Cookie: sessionId=abc123; theme=dark
```

**`If-Modified-Since`**
Conditional request—returns the resource only if it changed after the given date. Used with `Last-Modified` for cache revalidation.
```
If-Modified-Since: Wed, 21 Oct 2023 07:28:00 GMT
```

**`Referer`**
The URL of the page that linked to the current resource. Note the historical misspelling.
```
Referer: https://example.com/previous-page
```

**`User-Agent`**
Identifies the client—browser, SDK, or monitoring tool.
```
User-Agent: OpenStatus-Monitor/1.0
```

## Response Headers

**`Cache-Control`**
How and how long responses can be cached. Key directives:
- `max-age=3600` — cache for 1 hour
- `s-maxage=60` — CDN-specific override
- `no-cache` — revalidate before serving cached content
- `no-store` — never cache

**`Content-Length`**
The response body size in bytes.

**`ETag`**
A fingerprint for a specific version of a resource. Clients echo it back in `If-None-Match`; unchanged resources return `304 Not Modified` with no body.

**`Location`**
Target URL for redirect responses (`3xx`).
```
Location: https://api.example.com/users/123
```

**`Server`**
The server software that generated the response. Often worth stripping in production to reduce information exposure.
```
Server: nginx/1.21.0
```

**`Set-Cookie`**
Instructs the client to store a cookie with given attributes.
```
Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict
```

---

## Security Headers

**`Content-Security-Policy`**
Controls which resources the browser can load. Primary defense against XSS.
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
```

**`Strict-Transport-Security`**
Forces HTTPS for future requests. `includeSubDomains` extends coverage.
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

**`X-Content-Type-Options`**
Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing the declared content type.
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

**`X-Frame-Options`**
Protects against clickjacking by controlling iframe embedding.
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

## Proxy and Infrastructure Headers

Set by reverse proxies, load balancers, and CDNs—not your origin server.

| Header | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `X-Forwarded-For` | Chain of IPs through each proxy |
| `X-Forwarded-Host` | Original `Host` before proxy rewrites |
| `X-Forwarded-Proto` | Original protocol (`http` or `https`) |
| `X-Real-IP` | Original client IP, set by the first proxy |
| `X-Request-ID` | Unique identifier for tracing a request across services |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed in a window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets |

---

## Cloud Provider Headers

Each provider injects its own headers. Recognizing them tells you which layer handled the request—and where to look when something fails.

### Cloudflare

| Header | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CF-Ray` | Unique request ID—always include this in Cloudflare support tickets |
| `CF-Cache-Status` | `HIT`, `MISS`, `EXPIRED`, or `BYPASS` |
| `CF-Connecting-IP` | Original client IP—prefer this over `X-Forwarded-For` behind Cloudflare |
| `CF-IPCountry` | Two-letter country code of the client |

### Vercel

| Header | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `X-Vercel-Id` | Unique request ID, includes region prefix (e.g. `cdg1::`) |
| `X-Vercel-Cache` | `HIT`, `MISS`, or `STALE` from Vercel's edge cache |

### Fly.io

| Header | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Fly-Request-Id` | Unique request ID for tracing |
| `Fly-Region` | The region that handled the request (e.g. `ams`, `lax`) |

### Railway / Koyeb

Both proxy requests through standard infrastructure. Expect `X-Forwarded-*` headers; request IDs may appear as `X-Request-Id` or `X-Correlation-Id` depending on your app framework.

## Why This Matters for Monitoring

Response headers reveal more than status codes alone:

- `CF-Cache-Status: HIT` means you're hitting the cache, not your origin
- `X-Vercel-Id` with an unexpected region prefix can reveal routing issues
- Missing `Strict-Transport-Security` on production is worth alerting on
- `Cache-Control: no-store` on a high-traffic route means zero caching is helping you
