faq:
  - question: "Why should I publish public postmortems instead of hiding incidents?"
    answer: "Public postmortems demonstrate engineering depth, operational maturity, and build trust that no marketing can replicate. When GitLab live-streamed their database recovery, they gained massive respect from the developer community instead of losing customers. Transparency proves you understand your systems and take incidents seriously."
  - question: "What should I include in an incident postmortem?"
    answer: "Include five key elements: a clear timeline with exact timestamps, deep root cause analysis (not just symptoms), blameless language focused on systems not individuals, concrete action items with owners and deadlines, and leadership visibility showing founders take responsibility."
  - question: "When should I start communicating about an incident?"
    answer: "Start immediately when the incident begins - don't wait for the postmortem. Share real-time updates on your status page, Twitter/X, and Slack communities as you respond. The postmortem comes later as thorough analysis, but transparency starts the moment something breaks."
  - question: "What's the difference between a status page update and a postmortem?"
    answer: "Status page updates are real-time communications during active incidents telling users what's happening now. Postmortems are detailed analyses published after resolution, explaining root causes, systemic failures, and prevention plans. Great companies do both - immediate transparency plus thorough follow-up."
  - question: "Won't admitting failures publicly make my company look incompetent?"
    answer: "The opposite is true. Shallow or hidden responses to incidents signal shallow engineering culture. Detailed postmortems with root cause analysis and systemic thinking prove your team understands their systems. Technical buyers evaluating your infrastructure find this reassuring, not concerning."

**TL;DR**: Public incident postmortems build more trust than any marketing campaign. Companies like GitLab, Cloudflare, and Vercel have proven that radical transparency during outages - sharing real-time updates, detailed root cause analysis, and concrete action plans - turns potential PR disasters into proof of engineering maturity. Build in public, incidents included.

Incidents in public. That's the move most companies are too afraid to make.

You ship fast, something breaks, users get angry, and your first instinct is to go quiet. Minimize. Craft a vague statement about "intermittent issues" and hope everyone moves on. But the companies that have earned the deepest trust from developers do the exact opposite. They open the door, show you the fire, and walk you through how they put it out.

Public postmortems aren't designed to be marketing - but radical transparency when things break builds the kind of trust that no landing page ever will.

## Your Status Page Is Not Enough

When something goes wrong, users don't just want to know _that_ things are broken. They want to know _why_ - not _who_ to blame, but what actually failed. They want to know you understand the problem, that you're not just restarting servers and hoping for the best.

A status page that says "Degraded Performance - Investigating" tells your users nothing. What actually builds trust is going further: sharing a timeline of events as they unfold, explaining what component failed and why, and giving users enough context to make their own decisions.

The best companies start communicating before the postmortem is even written. They share updates in real time - on their status page, on Twitter/X, in Slack communities - so users aren't left guessing. The postmortem comes later as a thorough analysis, but transparency starts the moment something breaks.

Companies like [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/post-mortem/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/postmortem-on-next-js-middleware-bypass) have turned this into an art form. When incidents hit, their CEOs publish detailed technical breakdowns with minute-by-minute timelines, root cause analysis, and specific systemic changes. No sanitized corporate apologies. No "we take reliability seriously." Just: here's exactly what broke, here's exactly why, and here's what we're doing about it.

## GitLab: The Postmortem That Became a Legend

Perhaps the most famous example in tech history: in January 2017, a GitLab engineer accidentally deleted 300GB of production data from the primary database instead of a secondary replica. To make it worse, they discovered that five different backup systems had all been silently failing.

What GitLab did next was unprecedented. They opened a public Google Doc and updated it in real time as they worked through the recovery. They live-streamed the entire recovery process on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0TRHLvYGE0). CEO Sid Sijbrandij was visible throughout, and senior GitLab engineers showed up on Hacker News to answer questions and own the mistake.

The [postmortem they published](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/postmortem-of-database-outage-of-january-31/) was brutally honest. It named specific systems that failed, explained exactly why each backup mechanism was broken, and laid out a concrete plan for fixing every gap. The general reaction across the industry wasn't ridicule - it was respect. GitLab actually gained goodwill through the worst outage in their history because of how they handled it.

## What Makes a Postmortem Actually Build Trust

Great postmortems share five characteristics:

**A clear, honest timeline.** Minute-by-minute breakdowns of what happened, when it was detected, and how the team responded. No vague language. No "approximately" when you know the exact timestamp.

**Root cause analysis that goes deep.** Not "a configuration change caused the outage" but _why_ that configuration change was possible, what safeguards should have caught it, and why they didn't. Use the "Five Whys" technique (asking "why" repeatedly to dig past symptoms) to uncover systemic issues.

**Blameless language, not nameless language.** Focus on systems and processes, not individuals. Say "a network engineer" not "John from the ops team." Create an environment where people share what actually happened instead of the sanitized version.

**Concrete action items with owners.** Not "we will improve our monitoring" but "we are adding automated validation for configuration files before deployment, owned by the platform team, shipping by Q2."

**Leadership visibility.** When the CEO or CTO puts their name on the postmortem, it signals the company treats this seriously. These aren't engineers being told to write a blog post - these are founders saying "this happened on my watch and here's what we're doing about it."

### What to Avoid in Incident Postmortems

Just as important as what to include: skip the corporate speak, avoid deflecting blame to vendors, and never publish vague action items like "we'll monitor this more closely." These undermine the very trust you're trying to build.

## Why Admitting Failure Is Better Marketing Than Hiding It

Most companies think admitting failure makes them look weak. The opposite is true.

When GitLab published their database deletion postmortem, the Hacker News thread hit the front page and stayed there for days. Instead of a mass exodus, they gained massive respect from the developer community. Their transparency turned what could have been a reputation crisis into proof of operational maturity.

A thorough postmortem demonstrates things that matter to technical buyers:

**Engineering depth.** A shallow postmortem reveals shallow engineering culture. A deep one - with detailed root cause analysis and systemic thinking - shows your team actually understands their own systems. That's reassuring if someone is evaluating whether to trust you with their infrastructure.

**Operational maturity.** Companies that respond to incidents quickly, communicate transparently, and execute on remediation are companies that have their act together. The postmortem is proof.

**Industry authority.** When your incident reports help other engineers avoid the same mistakes, you become a trusted voice in the community - the kind that makes engineers choose you over competitors with bigger marketing budgets.

**Content that performs.** Public postmortems attract backlinks, get shared on Hacker News and Reddit, and become canonical references for specific failure modes. They're some of the highest-performing technical content you can publish.

## Build in Public - Incidents Included

The "build in public" movement has taught us that sharing your journey - wins and losses - builds trust with your audience. Public postmortems are the natural extension of that philosophy. If you're willing to share your roadmap, your metrics, and your product decisions, why hide the moments when things break?

Every company has incidents. The ones that earn long-term trust own them publicly, explain what happened clearly, and show their work on prevention. Your next outage isn't just a crisis to manage - it's an opportunity to show your users exactly who you are when things are on fire.

## Start Building Trust Through Transparency

Most companies will keep hiding behind vague status updates. That's your competitive advantage.

The question isn't whether you'll have an incident - it's whether you'll have the courage to be honest about it. Start with your status page: make it transparent, update it in real-time during incidents, and follow up with detailed postmortems that help others learn from your mistakes.

When your database catches fire and 5,000 people watch you put it out, that's not a disaster - that's the kind of trust you can't buy with any marketing budget.
