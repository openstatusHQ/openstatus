Today, we're introducing status page add-ons, bringing new features like white-labeling and email authentication to the plan.

## Why Add-ons?

We're committed to keeping our core product accessible while offering advanced capabilities for teams with specific needs. These add-ons help you:

- **Scale**: Add capacity as your infrastructure grows
- **Control access**: Restrict who can view your status information
- **Build trust**: Present a fully branded experience to your customers

## Add-ons

### Email Authentication

Protect your status pages with domain-based access control. Configure allowed email domains to restrict visibility to specific users or organizations. Visitors must verify their email address (via magic link) before accessing your status page.

Perfect for:
- Internal status pages shared only with your team
- Customer-facing pages restricted to specific organizations
- Meeting compliance requirements around information disclosure
- Limiting sensitive incident details to authorized stakeholders

**Pricing**: $200/mo., applies to all status pages in your workspace

### White Label

Remove the "powered by openstatus.dev" branding from your status pages. Present a completely branded experience that aligns with your company's identity. Your customers will see only your brand, maintaining consistency across all touchpoints.

Perfect for teams that need:
- Complete control over customer-facing assets
- Consistent branding across all touchpoints
- Professional appearance without third-party attribution
- A fully branded experience for customers and stakeholders

**Pricing**: $300/mo., applies to all status pages in your workspace

### Additional Status Pages

Scale beyond your plan's included status pages with flexible per-page pricing. Whether you're managing multiple products, regional deployments, or client-specific status pages, grow your monitoring infrastructure without upgrading your entire plan.

Perfect for:
- Multi-product companies with separate status pages
- Agencies managing client status pages
- Regional deployments with localized status communication
- Separate pages for testing and staging environments

**Pricing**: $20/mo. per additional status page
