## Every page should be an MDX file

If you're a small team with limited time, stop chasing pixel-perfect marketing pages. Embrace simplicity instead. MDX with a few reusable components is all you need:

- no wasted hours tweaking layouts
- ship meaningful content fast
- stay focused on what really matters

Most “beautiful” marketing sites are built to impress investors, not help users. The truth is, your users care about your product - not your gradients or fancy scroll effects.
Reduce the mental overhead. Write content in MDX, publish quickly, and spend your time improving what actually delivers value.

It’s time to embrace simplicity and focus on your users.
