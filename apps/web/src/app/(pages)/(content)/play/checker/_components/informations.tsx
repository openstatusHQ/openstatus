          <h3 className="font-semibold">What Is a Website Speed Checker?</h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            A Website Speed Checker is an online tool that measures how fast
            your website or API responds when someone visits it. It analyzes
            various website performance metrics to help you understand which
            elements slow down your page load time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Speed checkers can focus on two aspects of performance:
          </p>

                Client-side performance
              </strong>
              , which includes metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP),
              Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
              â€” all indicators of how quickly your site becomes visible and
              usable to visitors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">
                Server-side performance (or network performance)
              </strong>
              , which looks at the technical steps of a request such as DNS
              lookup, TCP connection, TLS handshake, and server response time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Understanding both sides helps you identify whether slowdowns are
            caused by your frontend assets or your backend infrastructure.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            A Global Speed Checker measures your website or API's latency and
            response time from multiple locations around the world. Instead of
            testing from just one data center, it runs checks from{" "}
            {TOTAL_REGIONS} global regions across {TOTAL_PROVIDERS.size} cloud
            providers, giving you a complete picture of your site's real-world
            performance.
